### 2 Monitoring of the terminal determined unit cost (DUC) at charging zone level
  The **Determined Unit Cost (DUC)** is the cost per service unit, at which the service is planned to be provided during the year. The **Actual Unit Cost (AUC)** reflects the cost per service unit, at which the service has actually been provided during the year.<br/><br/>The monitoring of the DUC / AUC is carried out in national currency in real terms, at 2017 prices.

### 4 Focus on terminal DUC monitoring at charging zone level

<p style="margin-bottom: 0rem;">**AUC vs. DUC**</p>

In 2022, the terminal AUC was -2.0% (or -36.04 NOK2017, -3.86 €2017) lower than the planned DUC resulting from significantly higher than planned TNSUs (+7.5%) and higher than planned terminal costs in real terms (+5.3%, or +20.0 MNOK2017, +2.1 M€2017). It should be noted that actual inflation index in 2022 was +6.5 p.p. higher than planned.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0rem;">**Terminal service units**</p>

The difference between actual and planned TNSUs (+7.5%) falls outside the ±2% dead band, but does not exceed the ±10% threshold foreseen in the traffic risk sharing mechanism. Hence the additional terminal revenue is shared between the ANSP and the airspace users, with the ANSP (Avinor) retaining an amount of +1.3 M€2017.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0rem;">**Terminal costs by entity**</p>

Actual real terminal costs are +5.3% (+2.1 M€2017) higher than planned. This is the result of higher costs for the main ANSP, Avinor (+5.1%, or +2.0 M€2017) and the MET service provider (+19.0%, or +0.2 M€2017) and lower costs for the NSA (-7.0%, or -0.01 M€2017).

<p style="margin-bottom: 0rem;">**Terminal costs for the main ANSP (Avinor) at charging zone level**</p>

Significantly higher than planned terminal costs in real terms for Avinor in 2022 (+5.1%, or +2.0 M€2017) result from the combination of:<br/>- Significantly higher staff costs (+6.4%), the main driver being the significantly higher than planned traffic at Norwegian regulated airports;<br/>- Significantly higher other operating costs (+6.6%), resulting from higher than planned travel, consultancy and energy costs, and to a lesser extent, re-allocation between staff and other operating cost, linked with the organizational restructuring (see Box 4 for en route); <br/>- Lower depreciation (-2.2%), *"due to the delayed capitalization of the new terminal radar at Oslo airport"*;<br/>- Slightly higher cost of capital (+0.4%), due to a slightly higher asset base resulting from the higher investment level than foreseen in the performance plan for RP3; and,<br/>- Higher deduction for VFR exempted flights (+4.3%).<br/>

### 5 Monitoring of the terminal actual unit cost for users (AUCU) at charging zone level
The **Actual Unit Cost for Users(AUCU)** reflects the price per service units that is charged *in fine* to users for the services provided in the year. It corresponds to the sum of the DUC for the year and of the different adjustments stemming from that year.
The monitoring of the AUCU is carried out in national currency in nominal terms.

### 9 Focus on terminal AUCU monitoring at charging zone level
The actual terminal unit cost incurred by airspace users (AUCU) in respect of activities performed in 2022 (1 827.99 NOK or 181.06 €) is -8.5% lower than the nominal DUC (1 998.23 NOK or 197.92 €). The difference between these two figures (-170.24 NOK/SU or -16.86 €/SU) is due to:<br/>- the positive inflation adjustment resulting from higher than planned inflation (+90.73 NOK/SU or +8.99 €/SU);<br/>- the impact of adjustments resulting from the costs exempted from cost-sharing mechanism (+12.31 NOK/SU or +1.22 €/SU);<br/>- the deduction of the traffic risk sharing adjustments (-69.40 NOK/SU or -6.87 €/SU);<br/>- the deduction of the traffic adjustment (-3.09 NOK/SU or -0.31 €/SU) for the costs not subject to traffic risk sharing; and<br/>- application of a lower unit rate as foreseen in Art. 29(6) in year 2022  (-200.79 NOK/SU or -19.89 €/SU); and<br/>The share of regulatory result (see items 10 to 14) in the AUCU (before the deduction of other revenues) is 3.9%.
