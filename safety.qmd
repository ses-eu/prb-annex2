Note: EoSM questionnaire has been updated in RP3 using CANSO Standard of Excellence as the basis, maturity levels of study areas and calculation of the score have been updated too. A direct comparison with  maturity levels and scoring of EoSM used RP2 is not advisable.


### Observations															
Three out of five EoSM components of the ANSP meet the RP3 target level. One question need to improve to reach RP3 target for "Safety Risk Management". Compared with 2021, in 2022 degradation was observed in maturity level for "Safety Policy and Objectives" for one question, reducing the achieved level from C to B and consequently not achieving the target for this component.
