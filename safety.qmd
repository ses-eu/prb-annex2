Note: EoSM questionnaire has been updated in RP3 using CANSO Standard of Excellence as the basis, maturity levels of study areas and calculation of the score have been updated too. A direct comparison with  maturity levels and scoring of EoSM used RP2 is not advisable.


### Observations															
Three EoSM components are still below RP3 EoSM target levels. Over 2022, "Safety Culture" and "Safety Promotion" were improved and reached the target levels. However, some degradation was observed for "Safety Policy and Objectives" component. In total, nine questions are expected to be improved for remaining components during RP3 to achieve 2024 targets.
