Note: EoSM questionnaire has been updated in RP3 using CANSO Standard of Excellence as the basis, maturity levels of study areas and calculation of the score have been updated too. A direct comparison with  maturity levels and scoring of EoSM used RP2 is not advisable.


### Observations															
Four out of five EoSM components of the ANSP meet the RP3 EoSM target level. Only "Safety Risk Management" is below 2024 target level. Over 2022, one question was improved for this component, but two remaining questions are still below the RP3 target.
