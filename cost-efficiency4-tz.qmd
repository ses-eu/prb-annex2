### Monitoring of the terminal determined unit cost (DUC) at charging zone level
  The Determined Unit Cost (DUC) is the cost per service unit, at which the service is planned to be provided during the year. The Actual Unit Cost (AUC) reflects the cost per service unit, at which the service has actually been provided during the year.

The monitoring of the DUC / AUC is carried out in national currency in real terms, at 2017 prices.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0rem;">**AUC vs. DUC**</p>

In 2022, the terminal AUC was -2.1% (or -8.91 CHF2017, -8.02 €2017) lower than the planned  DUC. This results from the combination of significantly lower than planned terminal costs in real terms (-8.6%, or -8.9 MCHF2017, -8.0 M€2017) and significantly lower than planned TNSUs (-6.6%). It should be noted that actual inflation index in 2022 was +2.9 p.p. higher than planned.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0rem;">**Terminal service units**</p>

The difference between actual and planned TNSUs (-6.6%) falls outside the ±2% dead band, but does not exceed the ±10% threshold foreseen in the traffic risk sharing mechanism. The resulting loss of terminal revenues is therefore shared between the ANSP and the airspace users, with the ANSP (Skyguide) bearing a loss of -2.9 M€2017.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0rem;">**Terminal costs by entity**</p>

Actual real terminal costs are -8.6% (-8.0 M€2017) lower than planned. This is the result of lower costs for the main ANSP, Skyguide (-8.1%, or -7.2 M€2017) and the MET service provider (-20.2%, or -0.9 M€2017).

<p style="margin-bottom: 0rem;">**Terminal costs for the main ANSP (Skyguide) at charging zone level**</p>

Actual terminal costs in real terms are lower than planned  for Skyguide in 2022 (-8.1%, or -7.2 M€2017). However, the differences by nature of costs are distorted by the presentation of the additional costs caused by the change in the capitalisation rule in 2022 (+7.4 M€2017). Indeed, in order for these amounts not to be billed to airspace users, they have also been reported as negative exceptional items in the determined costs, but not in the actual costs (-100% of negative exceptional costs, or +7.4 M€2017). 
- the significant difference in staff costs (which is overall of -14.7 M€2017 or -26.4%), can be mainly explained by the evolution of the FTEs and salary assumptions, but it is also due to a reimbursement from the pension fund, although partially offset by the provision for ATCO retirement age transition costs.

### Monitoring of the terminal actual unit cost for users (AUCU) at charging zone level
The **Actual Unit Cost for Users(AUCU)** reflects the price per service units that is charged *in fine* to users for the services provided in the year. It corresponds to the sum of the DUC for the year and of the different adjustments stemming from that year.
The monitoring of the AUCU is carried out in national currency in nominal terms.

### Focus on terminal AUCU monitoring at charging zone level
The actual terminal unit cost incurred by airspace users (AUCU) in respect of activities performed in 2022 (432.77 CHF or 430.65 €) is +1.1% higher than the nominal DUC (428.04 CHF or 425.94 €). The difference between these two figures (+4.73 CHF/SU or +4.71 €/SU) is due to:
- the positive inflation adjustment resulting from higher than planned inflation (+10.04 CHF/SU or +9.99 €/SU);
- the impact of adjustments resulting from the costs exempted from cost-sharing mechanism (-5.73 CHF/SU or -5.70 €/SU);
- the addition of the traffic risk sharing adjustments (+14.12 CHF/SU or +14.05 €/SU);
- the addition of the traffic adjustment (+1.54 CHF/SU or +1.53 €/SU) for the costs not subject to traffic risk sharing; and
- application of a lower unit rate as foreseen in Art. 29(6) in year 2022 (-15.23 CHF/SU or -15.16 €/SU).
The share of the regulatory result (see items 10 to 14) in the AUCU (before the deduction of other revenues) is 7.6%.
