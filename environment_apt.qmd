### Overview

Latvia identified 3 airports as subject to RP3 monitoring. In accordance with IR (EU) 2019/317 and the traffic figures at these 3 airports, additional taxi-out and ASMA times are not monitored and the environmental performance focuses only on the share of arrivals applying CDO.<br/>The shares of CDO flights increased at all airports. The shares of CDO flights at Riga and Ventstpils were well above the overall RP3 value in 2022.
