## Airports
### Overview

Austria identified six airports as subject to RP3 monitoring. According to the traffic figures at these 6 airports, only Vienna (LOWW) must be monitored for additional taxi-out and ASMA times. <br />The Airport Operator Data Flow, necessary for the monitoring of the additional times, is correctly established where required and the monitoring of all environment indicators can be performed.<br />Traffic at the ensemble of these airports increased by 58% in 2022 with respect to 2021 but it is still 25% below 2019 levels.<br />Observed additional times at Vienna remain low- compared to pre-COVID levels. The share of CDO flights reduced from 29.2% to 27.9% in 2022.
