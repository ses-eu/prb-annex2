## 3.2 Airports
### Overview
Finland identifies only Helsinki airport as subject to RP3 monitoring. 
The Airport Operator Data Flow is fully established and the monitoring of all capacity indicators can be performed. Nevertheless, the quality of the reporting does not allow for the calculation of the ATC pre-departure delay, with more than 60% of the reported delay not allocated to any cause.
Traffic at this airport in 2022 is still 32% lower with respect to 2019, but 84% above 2021 levels.
Average arrival ATFM delays in 2022 were 0.06 min/arr, compared to 0.1 min/arr in 2021.
ATFM slot adherence has slightly improved (2022: 95.6%; 2021: 93.1%).
