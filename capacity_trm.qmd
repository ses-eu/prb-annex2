## Airports
### Overview
Austria identified six airports as subject to RP3 monitoring. According to the traffic figures at these 4 airports, only Vienna (LOWW) must be monitored for pre-departure delays. <br/>The Airport Operator Data Flow, necessary for the monitoring of these pre-departure delays, is correctly established where required and the monitoring of all capacity indicators can be performed.<br/>Traffic at the ensemble of these airports increased by 58% in 2022 with respect to 2021 but it is still 25% below 2019 levels.<br/><br/>During 2022, arrival ATFM delays in Austria remained very low and ATFM slot adherence improved (2022: 98.8%; 2021: 97.4%) resulting in values above 95% for all airports.


### Arrival ATFM Delay
![](images/2022/Austria/cap_trm_3_1.png)
Average arrival ATFM delay in Austria in 2022 was 0.15 min/arr, compared to 0.11 min/arr in 2021. 
Only Vienna and Innsbruck registered delays in 2022.
At Vienna (LOWW: 2019: 0.91 min/arr.; 2020: 0.49 min/arr.; 2021: 0.14 min/arr.; 2022: 0.19 min/arr.) 68% of these delays were attributed to weather and 26% to ATC staffing issues. 
Innsbruck (LOWI: 2020: 0.18 min/arr.; 2021: 0.09 min/arr.; 2021: 0.17 min/arr.; 2022: 0.17 min/arr.) observed arrival ATFM delays only in January, February and December and were all related to weather.
According to the Austrian monitoring report there were no changes in TFC flows / patterns around airports due to the Russian war.

### ATFM Slot Adherence
![](images/2022/Austria/cap_trm_1_1.png)
All Austrian airports showed adherence above 95% and the national average was 98.8%, an improvement with respect to 2021 (97.4%). With regard to the 1.2% of flights that did not adhere, 0.9% was early and 0.3% was late
According to the Austrian monitoring report: In general, slot adherence improved again, compared to the previous COVID years and has reached the high standards as before COVID-19. 
                      


### ATC Pre-departure Delay
Vienna is the only Austrian airport subject to the monitoring of this indicator. The performance has deteriorated (LOWW; 2019: 1.56 min/dep.; 2020: 0.75 min/dep.; 2021: 0.63 min/dep.; 2022: 0.92min/dep.) but remained under 2019 values.<br/>According to the Austrian monitoring report: *Performance is stable and improved even in comparison to traffic volumes of previous years, including 2019 and 2018. Main reason is full implementation of Airport CDM since April 2022.*


### All Causes Pre-departure Delay
Vienna is the only Austrian airport subject to the monitoring of this indicator. <br/>The total (all causes) delay in the actual off block time at Vienna in 2022 increased drastically to 14.60 min/dep. The highest delays per flight were observed from June to August.<br/>According to the Austrian monitoring report: *Increasing traffic caused additional 'All cause departure delays per flight'. No ATC Departure Delays have been applied. *
