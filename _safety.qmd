Note: EoSM questionnaire has been updated in RP3 using CANSO Standard of Excellence as the basis, maturity levels of study areas and calculation of the score have been updated too. A direct comparison with  maturity levels and scoring of EoSM used RP2 is not advisable.


### Observations															
Four EoSM components of the ANSP meet or exceed the RP3 target level. 
Compared with 2021, in 2022 degradation was observed for four questions, including one question for "Safety Risk Management" reducing the maturity of the component from level D to the level C, and consequently not achieving the target for this component. This question is to be improved during RP3 to achieve RP3 targets.
