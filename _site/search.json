The Airport Operator Data Flow, necessary for the monitoring of these pre-departure delays, is correctly established where required and the monitoring of all capacity indicators can be performed.Traffic at the ensemble of these airports increased by 58% in 2022 with respect to 2021 but it is still 25% below 2019 levels.During 2022, arrival ATFM delays in Austria remained very low and ATFM slot adherence improved (2022: 98.8%; 2021: 97.4%) resulting in values above 95% for all airports.\n\n\n\n Average arrival ATFM delay in Austria in 2022 was 0.15 min/arr, compared to 0.11 min/arr in 2021. Only Vienna and Innsbruck registered delays in 2022. At Vienna (LOWW: 2019: 0.91 min/arr.; 2020: 0.49 min/arr.; 2021: 0.14 min/arr.; 2022: 0.19 min/arr.) 68% of these delays were attributed to weather and 26% to ATC staffing issues. Innsbruck (LOWI: 2020: 0.18 min/arr.; 2021: 0.09 min/arr.; 2021: 0.17 min/arr.; 2022: 0.17 min/arr.) observed arrival ATFM delays only in January, February and December and were all related to weather. According to the Austrian monitoring report there were no changes in TFC flows / patterns around airports due to the Russian war.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe national target on arrival ATFM delay in 2022 was met.\n\n\n\n\n\n All Austrian airports showed adherence above 95% and the national average was 98.8%, an improvement with respect to 2021 (97.4%). With regard to the 1.2% of flights that did not adhere, 0.9% was early and 0.3% was late According to the Austrian monitoring report: In general, slot adherence improved again, compared to the previous COVID years and has reached the high standards as before COVID-19.\n\n\n\nVienna is the only Austrian airport subject to the monitoring of this indicator. The performance has deteriorated (LOWW; 2019: 1.56 min/dep.; 2020: 0.75 min/dep.; 2021: 0.63 min/dep.; 2022: 0.92min/dep.) but remained under 2019 values.According to the Austrian monitoring report: Performance is stable and improved even in comparison to traffic volumes of previous years, including 2019 and 2018. Main reason is full implementation of Airport CDM since April 2022.\n\n\n\nVienna is the only Austrian airport subject to the monitoring of this indicator. The total (all causes) delay in the actual off block time at Vienna in 2022 increased drastically to 14.60 min/dep. The highest delays per flight were observed from June to August.According to the Austrian monitoring report: Increasing traffic caused additional ‘All cause departure delays per flight’. No ATC Departure Delays have been applied. \n\n\n\nn/a: airport operator data flow not established, or more than two months of missing / non-validated data",

Staff availability was still impaired by various waves of the pandemic, yet the provision of ANS was not severely impacted. Capacity targets were met despite the return of traffic, shifted traffic flows due to the Russian war of agression against Ukraine and ongoing COVID effects on staff availability.\n\n\nMonitoring process for capacity performance\nApart from permanent ATFCM processes in place, monitoring traffic during the strategic, pretactical, and tactical phase as well as post OPS analyses are regularly executed. Furthermore, a daily, weekly, monthly, yearly monitoring of capacity and delay is executed.\n\n\nCapacity Planning\nBased on NM TFC predictions (STATFOR, NOP), capacity is planned and managed in terms of sector opening hours based inter alia on human resources and traffic distribution.\n\n\nATCO in OPS (FTE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication of Corrective Measures for Capacity (if applicable)\nNot applicable.\n\n\nSummary of capacity performance\nAustria experienced an increase in traffic from 739k flights in 2021 to 1267k flights in 2022; however, traffic levels were still below the 1,365k flights in 2019. In 2022, Austro Control had 78k minutes of en-route AFTM delay, up from &lt;1k minutes of delay in 2021. However, in 2019 when Austria had 1365k flights, Austro Control had more than 1530k minutes of delay.There were an additional 27k minutes of en route ATFM delay originating in the Vienna ACC that were re-attributed to DFS (&gt;17k) and DSNA (&gt;9k) via the NM post operations delay attribution process, according to the NMB agreement for eNM/S22 measures, to ameliorate capacity shortfalls in both Karlsruhe UAC and Reims ACC.",

The Actual Unit Cost (AUC) reflects the cost per service unit, at which the service has actually been provided during the year.The monitoring of the DUC / AUC is carried out in national currency in real terms, at 2017 prices.\n\n\n3 En route actual unit cost (AUC) vs. en route determined unit cost (DUC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Focus on en route DUC monitoring at charging zone level\n\n\n\nAUC vs. DUC\n\nIn 2022, the en route AUC was -8.3% (or -5.18 €2017) lower than the planned DUC. This results from the combination of significantly higher than planned TSUs (+8.1%) and slightly lower than planned en route costs in real terms (-0.9%, or -1.7 M€2017). It should be noted that actual inflation index in 2022 was +7.0 p.p. higher than planned.\n\nEn route service units\n\nThe difference between actual and planned TSUs (+8.1%) falls outside the ±2% dead band, but does not exceed the ±10% threshold foreseen in the traffic risk sharing mechanism. The resulting gain of additional en route revenues is therefore shared between the ANSP and the airspace users, with the ANSP (Austro Control) retaining an amount of +5.8 M€2017.\n\nEn route costs by entity\n\nActual real en route costs are -0.9% (-1.7 M€2017) lower than planned. This is the result of lower costs for the MET service provider (-14.0%, or -1.7 M€2017) and the NSA/EUROCONTROL (-1.7%, or -0.2 M€2017) and higher costs for the main ANSP, Austro Control (+0.1%, or +0.2 M€2017).\n\nEn route costs for the main ANSP (Austro Control) at charging zone level\n\nSlightly higher than planned en route costs in real terms for Austro Control in 2022 (+0.1%, or +0.2 M€2017) result from:- Higher staff costs (+3.8%), due to overtime hours to cope with the increase in traffic, impact of the inflation on salaries and the higher pension costs than determined;- Lower other operating costs (-4.7%), mainly due to the inflation index impact (+7.0 p.p.) since in nominal terms the costs are just slightly higher than planned (+1.4%);- Lower depreciation (-9.3%), reflecting delays in investments due to the impact of COVID-19; - Significantly lower cost of capital (-25.6%) reflecting delayed investments and “short-term financing conditions of the Republic of Austria, due to which the average net working capital was subject to interest at 0% in 2021” - Lower exceptional costs (-6.0%), due to the inflation index (+7.0 p.p.) since in nominal terms the actual costs are equal to determined; and,- Lower deduction for VFR exempted flights (-6.6%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 Monitoring of the en route actual unit cost for users (AUCU) at charging zone level\nThe Actual Unit Cost for Users(AUCU) reflects the price per service units that is charged in fine to users for the services provided in the year.

The monitoring of the AUCU is carried out in national currency in nominal terms.\n\n\n6 En route actual unit cost for users (AUCU) at charging zone level\n\n\n\n* The traffic adjustment on adjustments is not considered to avoid double counting, as the related adjustments have already been taken into account in full in the AUCU for the current year or previous years.** The difference in revenue due to the application of the temporary unit rates in 2022, if applicable, is already reflected in the DUC (part to be charged retroactively) and is therefore not considered in the total adjustments, in order to avoid double counting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 En route costs exempt from cost sharing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: These data are taken from the June 2023 en route Reporting Tables (for Eurocontrol costs and costs of competent authorities and qualified entities) and from the “NSA Report on the verification of cost risk sharing for the year 2022” submitted in accordance with Article 28 (7) of Regulation (EU) 2019/317 (for ANSPs costs).\n\n\n8 En route regulatory result at charging zone level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** before deduction of other revenues, as is the case for the regulatory results (see items 10 to 14)\n\n\n\n\n9 Focus on en route AUCU monitoring at charging zone level\nThe actual en route unit cost incurred by airspace users (AUCU) in respect of activities performed in 2022 (67.45 €) is +0.4% higher than the nominal DUC (67.16 €). The difference between these two figures (+0.29 €/SU) is due to:- the positive inflation adjustment resulting from higher than planned inflation (+3.20 €/SU);- the impact of adjustments resulting from the costs exempted from cost-sharing mechanism (+0.04 €/SU);- the deduction of the traffic risk sharing adjustments (-2.34 €/SU); and- the deduction of the traffic adjustment (-0.62 €/SU) for the costs not subject to traffic risk sharing.The share of the regulatory result (see items 10 to 14) in the AUCU (before the deduction of other revenues) is 4.3%.",
