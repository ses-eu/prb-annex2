One question need to improve to reach RP3 target for “Safety Risk Management”.

Sanctions imposed by EU, along with the sanctions imposed by Russia against EU, changed the traffic flows dramatically.Traffic flow between Russia to Europe stopped, while the Europe ↔︎ China and Europe ↔︎ SE Asia segments dramatically dropped. Due to restrictions on overflying EU airspace, Russian aircraft operators started to fly over high seas in the Baltic sea in order to connect Kaliningrad to mainland Russia. This increased the traffic in Latvian delegated airspace, but has a negative impact on the receivables of the ANSP.Due to Russian invasion in Ukraine and the EU sanctions against the Russia and Belorussia, air traffic flows have remained at approximately 60% of 2019 air traffic level. No capacity issues have been identified.\n\n\nMonitoring process for capacity performance\nCapacity monitoring takes place during annual inspections, in addition to regular monthly statistical data sent by the LGS to the LV CAA.\n\n\nCapacity Planning\nCapacity planning measures by LGS are checked during annual inspections.\n\n\nATCO in OPS (FTE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication of Corrective Measures for Capacity (if applicable)\nNot applicable\n\n\nSummary of capacity performance\nLatvia experienced an increase in traffic from 163k flights in 2021, with zero ATFM delay, to 190k flights in 2022, also with zero en route ATFM delay.

The Actual Unit Cost (AUC) reflects the cost per service unit, at which the service has actually been provided during the year.The monitoring of the DUC / AUC is carried out in national currency in real terms, at 2017 prices.\n\n\n3 En route actual unit cost (AUC) vs. en route determined unit cost (DUC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Focus on en route DUC monitoring at charging zone level\n\n\n\nAUC vs. DUCIn 2022, the en route AUC was -6.0% (or -2.27 €2017) lower than the planned DUC. This results from the combination of significantly lower than planned en route costs in real terms (-6.0%, or -1.1 M€2017) and TSUs that are in line with the plan. It should be noted that actual inflation index in 2022 was +7.8 p.p. higher than planned.En route service unitsThe difference between actual and planned TSUs (-0.1%) falls inside the ±2% dead band. Hence loss of en route revenues is borne by the ANSPs (see items 10 to 14).En route costs by entityActual real en route costs are -6.0% (-1.1 M€2017) lower than planned. This is the result of lower costs for the main ANSP, LGS (-5.8%, or -0.9 M€2017), the NSA/EUROCONTROL (-7.4%, or -0.2 M€2017) and the MET service provider (-6.6%, or -0.02 M€2017).En route costs for the main ANSP (LGS) at charging zone levelSignificantly lower than planned en route costs in real terms for LGS in 2022 (-5.8%, or -0.9 M€2017) result from:- Significantly lower staff costs (-9.1%), mainly due to the war in Ukraine, which did not allow a return to pre-COVID situation and had an impact on staff plan and on reallocation of costs between En-route and Terminal, based on Activity Based Costing method.- Significantly lower other operating costs (-13.1%), resulting from austerity measures required by the new crisis situation (ATCOs training courses cancelled, reduction of direct spending for ATCOs…). - Significantly higher depreciation (+7.4%), due to the commissioning of several large investment projects, mostly related to ATS and launched before the pandemic. A number of unplanned investments for the ACC also resulted in higher-than-expected costs.- Significantly higher cost of capital (+6.4%). This can be explained by the fact that a number of investments were commissioned slightly earlier than planned, resulting in higher costs.- Significantly lower deduction for VFR exempted flights (-12.4%).**\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 Monitoring of the en route actual unit cost for users (AUCU) at charging zone level\nThe Actual Unit Cost for Users(AUCU) reflects the price per service units that is charged in fine to users for the services provided in the year. It corresponds to the sum of the DUC for the year and of the different adjustments stemming from that year. The monitoring of the AUCU is carried out in national currency in nominal terms.\n\n\n6 En route actual unit cost for users (AUCU) at charging zone level\n\n\n\n* The traffic adjustment on adjustments is not considered to avoid double counting, as the related adjustments have already been taken into account in full in the AUCU for the current year or previous years.** The difference in revenue due to the application of the temporary unit rates in 2022, if applicable, is already reflected in the DUC (part to be charged retroactively) and is therefore not considered in the total adjustments, in order to avoid double counting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 En route costs exempt from cost sharing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: These data are taken from the June 2023 en route Reporting Tables (for Eurocontrol costs and costs of competent authorities and qualified entities) and from the “NSA Report on the verification of cost risk sharing for the year 2022” submitted in accordance with Article 28 (7) of Regulation (EU) 2019/317 (for ANSPs costs).\n\n\n8 En route regulatory result at charging zone level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** before deduction of other revenues, as is the case for the regulatory results (see items 10 to 14)\n\n\n\n\n9 Focus on en route AUCU monitoring at charging zone level\nThe actual en route unit cost incurred by airspace users (AUCU) in respect of activities performed in 2022 (44.43 €) is +3.3% higher than the nominal DUC (43.03 €). The difference between these two figures (+1.40 €/SU) is due to:- the positive inflation adjustment resulting from higher than planned inflation (+1.99 €/SU);- the impact of adjustments resulting from the costs exempted from cost-sharing mechanism (-0.23 €/SU);- the addition of the traffic adjustment (+0.01 €/SU) for the costs not subject to traffic risk sharing; and- the deduction of the other revenues (-0.36 €/SU).The share of the regulatory result (see items 10 to 14) in the AUCU (before the deduction of other revenues) is 11.2%."
