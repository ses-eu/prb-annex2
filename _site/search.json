A direct comparison with maturity levels and scoring of EoSM used RP2 is not advisable.\n\n\nObservations\nMaturity levels have been maintained compared with 2021. Four out of five EoSM components of the ANSP meet the RP3 target level. Only the component “Safety Risk Management” is below 2024 target level, at level C. Improvements in “Safety Risk Management” are still expected during RP3 to achieve RP3 targets."

    "text": "En route charging zone\n\n1 Contextual economic information: en route air navigation services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Monitoring of the en route determined unit cost (DUC) at charging zone level\nThe Determined Unit Cost (DUC) is the cost per service unit, at which the service is planned to be provided during the year. The Actual Unit Cost (AUC) reflects the cost per service unit, at which the service has actually been provided during the year.The monitoring of the DUC / AUC is carried out in national currency in real terms, at 2017 prices.\n\n\n3 En route actual unit cost (AUC) vs. en route determined unit cost (DUC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Focus on en route DUC monitoring at charging zone level\n\n\n\nAUC vs. DUC\n\nIn 2022, the en route AUC was -15.3% (or -9.47 €2017) lower than the planned DUC. This results from the combination of significantly higher than planned TSUs (+11.1%) and significantly lower than planned en route costs in real terms (-5.9%, or -1.9 M€2017). It should be noted that the actual inflation index in 2022 was +9.5 p.p. higher than planned (115.5 vs. 106.0).\n\nEn route service units\n\nThe difference between actual and planned TSUs (+11.1%) falls outside the ±10% threshold foreseen in the traffic risk sharing mechanism. The resulting gain of additional en route revenues is therefore shared between the ANSP and the airspace users, with the ANSP (Slovenia Control) retaining an amount of +1.2 M€2017.\n\nEn route costs by entity\n\nActual real en route costs are -5.9% (-1.9 M€2017) lower than planned. This is the result of lower than planned costs for the main ANSP, Slovenia Control (-5.8%, or -1.7 M€2017) and the NSA/EUROCONTROL (-12.0%, or -0.3 M€2017) and higher than planned costs for the MET service provider (+4.8%, or +0.1 M€2017).\n\nEn route costs for the main ANSP (Slovenia Control) at charging zone level\n\nSignificantly lower than planned en route costs in real terms for Slovenia Control in 2022 (-5.8%, or -1.7 M€2017) resulting from:- Significantly lower than planned staff costs (-5.5%) in real terms, due to inflation index impact (+9.5 p.p.) since in nominal terms staff costs are higher than planned (+3.0%) due to “negotiations with the social partners reached for Q4 of 2021, when some obligations were pushed from 2021 to 2022” ,- Significantly lower than planned other operating costs (-11.8%) in real terms, reported to be due to “optimised contracts”,- Higher than planned depreciation (+2.4%),- Significantly lower than planned cost of capital (-11.8%), reported to be due to ”lower asset value”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 Monitoring of the en route actual unit cost for users (AUCU) at charging zone level\nThe Actual Unit Cost for Users(AUCU) reflects the price per service units that is charged in fine to users for the services provided in the year. It corresponds to the sum of the DUC for the year and of the different adjustments stemming from that year. The monitoring of the AUCU is carried out in national currency in nominal terms.\n\n\n6 En route actual unit cost for users (AUCU) at charging zone level\n\n\n\n* The traffic adjustment on adjustments is not considered to avoid double counting, as the related adjustments have already been taken into account in full in the AUCU for the current year or previous years.** The difference in revenue due to the application of the temporary unit rates in 2022, if applicable, is already reflected in the DUC (part to be charged retroactively) and is therefore not considered in the total adjustments, in order to avoid double counting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 En route costs exempt from cost sharing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: These data are taken from the June 2023 en route Reporting Tables (for Eurocontrol costs and costs of competent authorities and qualified entities) and from the “NSA Report on the verification of cost risk sharing for the year 2022” submitted in accordance with Article 28 (7) of Regulation (EU) 2019/317 (for ANSPs costs).\n\n\n8 En route regulatory result at charging zone level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** before deduction of other revenues, as is the case for the regulatory results (see items 10 to 14)\n\n\n\n\n9 Focus on en route AUCU monitoring at charging zone level\nThe actual en route unit cost incurred by airspace users (AUCU) in respect of activities performed in 2022 (64.31 €) is -1.1% lower than the nominal DUC (65.05 €). The difference between these two figures (-0.74 €/SU) is due to:- the positive inflation adjustment resulting from higher than planned inflation (+4.19 €/SU);- the impact of adjustments resulting from the costs exempted from cost-sharing mechanism (-0.70 €/SU);- the deduction of the traffic risk sharing adjustments (-3.46 €/SU); and- the deduction of the traffic adjustment (-0.76 €/SU) for the costs not subject to traffic risk sharing.The share of the regulatory result (see items 10 to 14) in the AUCU (before the deduction of other revenues) is 10.2%."
