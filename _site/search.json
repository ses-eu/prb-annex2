However, the differences by nature of costs are distorted by the presentation of the additional costs caused by the change in the capitalisation rule in 2022 (+7.4 M€2017).

The notion of RR focuses on the ANSP results entitled to the ANS activity in the year. It is therefore different from the net accounting profit disclosed in ANSPs financial statements. Also, it does not take into account any opportunity cost.\nThe RR, when expressed in percentage of the revenues, can be associated to a “margin” generated by the ANSP with respect to the activity of the year, but it is not comparable to the margin that would be calculated straight from ANSPs financial statements.\n\nEx-ante, the RR is equal to the RoE (in value) included in the determined cost of capital.\nEx-post, the RR is the sum of the RoE (in value) in the actual cost of capital and the net gain/loss resulting from risk sharing and incentives generated from that year.\n\nThe net gain/loss calculated in box 11 results from the combination of three distinct items: a) the outcome of the cost-sharing mechanism to be retained by the ANSP (including the impact of costs exempted from cost-sharing and of the inflation adjustment); b) the outcome of the traffic risk sharing mechanism; and c) the outcome of the financial incentive mechanism for capacity and environment targets (not applicable for 2022).\nThe monitoring of the RR is carried out in national currency in nominal terms.\nNote 1: Ex-post RR does not take into account the application of the lower unit rate as per Art. 29.6 in 2022.

    "text": "3.1 En route\n\nMinutes of ATFM en-route delay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations The value for en route ATFM delay per flight presented here is subsequent to the NM post operations delay attribution process.\n\n\n\n\nNSA’s assessment of capacity performance\n2022 en route capacity target set in the Swiss National performance plan was just not met for 2022 (total ATFM-Delay per flight : 0.21 min/fl., 0.02 min. above the target). The delay in 2022 was mainly caused by severe adverse weather conditions above the Alps, limited ATC capacity and to a lesser extent, staffing.\nHigh uncertainty on traffic recovery over medium term horizon (2-3 months), new traffic patterns and increased volatility had also an aggravating impact during the Summer period.\nIn 2022, Skyguide just missed its total en-route ATFM delay per flight. The main cause of delays were Weather (45%), ATC-Capacity (32%), Staffing (8%), Equipment (ATC) (7%), Other (6%) and Special Event (1%).\nBefore applying the post-ops adjustment process, the total en-route ATFM delay per flight reached 0.34 min / flight whereas the CRSTMP En-route ATFM delay per flight reached 0.15 min / flight as shown in the Capacity Report of the FABEC. After applying the post-ops adjustment process and re-attributing respectively 61 357 min to DSNA and 49 178 min to DFS according to the NM data, skyguide reached 0.21 for the total en-route ATFM delay per flight and 0.11 for the CRSTMP part.\nThe main cause of delay was weather. As Skyguide is in charge of air traffic control in the centre of the Alps, it is a lot more subject to strong adverse weather conditions than the major part of all the other ANSPs.\nAs a basis for comparison, the NM includes approximately 15% of delay due to Weather in its delay forecast. The fact that heavy CB situation begins to occur in May until September is obviously an aggravating factor as it happens exactly at the same time as the yearly peak of traffic demand, which has a tremendous impact on delays.\n\n\nMonitoring process for capacity performance\nThe monitoring for en-route capacity performance is carried out under the auspices of the FABEC Financial and Performance Committee (FPC), counterpart of the European Commission at the States side, consulting and reporting to FABEC Council as appropriate.\nOn a monthly basis and through the AFG/PMG (ANSP FABEC Group / Performance Management Group) the ANSPs collectively submit a report to the FPC, based on PRU available data, consolidated and analysed, on their joint progress in achieving the national target set and reference or indicative values and on the results and analysis of the en- route capacity achievement.\nIn case the national target set and/or the annual/reference values are threatened not to be met, AFG/PMG is asked to propose to FPC possible corrective measures which the ANSPs determine fit to react to the weaker performance at national and/or ACC level, in order to remedy the situation.\nThe FPC analyses the reports, assesses the actions considered by the ANSPs together with the necessity of appropriate measures to be taken by the States or the NSAs and makes an advice to the proposals, made by the AFG/PMG, to the FABEC Council for such appropriate measures, after consultation with the AFG/PMG. The potential corrective measures take into account the seriousness of the risk of not meeting the targets set and/or the annual/reference values.\nThe FPC is also responsible for the management of the Capacity KPA financial incentive schemes. This monitoring process is described in the FABEC FPC States Performance Process description, regularly updated.\nThe Swiss NSA has periodical meetings with its ANSPs. - The Swiss NSA is regularly provided with various reports, analysis and data such as FABEC monthly capacity reports (including Skyguide data), Skyguide reports, PRU dashboards which enable to closely monitor the performance evolution.\n\n\nCapacity Planning\nA NOP Recovery Plan process was initiated and launched by the Network Manager and its first edition was published on 30 April 2020, as European traffic began a slow recovery from its lowest point of just 2,099 flights across the network on 12 April 2020.\nSince then a weekly Rolling NOP, published every Friday has been introduced through which NM coordinates with all partners to ensure capacity is available at ACCs and in the airspace they manage, and on the ground at airports, to meet the expected traffic demand from the airlines on each day of the next six weeks enabling to coordinate all operational stakeholders throughout the pandemic to ensure that network actors can plan their recovery effectively based on predicted traffic levels.\nOn 6th May 2022, a first version of the new 2022-2026 NOP has been released (still based on the STATFOR forecast published in October 2021 as STATFOR has postponed the publication of its new forecast to October 2022). It included the capacity planning for skyguide with the latest available capacity information and remedial measures for all ACCs concerned by capacity issues.\nSkyguide is of course part of this process and contributes to the provision for a consolidated European network view of the evolution of the air traffic, enabling the planning of the service delivered in the recovery phase to match the expected air traffic demand in a safe, efficient and coordinated manner. However, the 10% capacity buffer requested by the NM, the recommendation for zero delay and the continuous optimistic traffic forecast selected have naturally an adverse impact on ANSPs finance.\nSkyguide implemented the cross-border airspace restructuring with Reims ACC and Basel APP, improved ATFCM procedures and STAM as well as the CDM procedures for Airspace requests level 2 and 3 (ASM - ATFCM), its optimized sector opening scheme to match the traffic demand, network weather mitigation measures, the FABEC airspace structure and implemented the FRA CH.\nIn parallel, Skyguide continued to develop its top priority programme: the Virtual Centre; in addition, Crystal, the traffic and complexity prediction tool is continuously improved.\n\n\nATCO in OPS (FTE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication of Corrective Measures for Capacity (if applicable)\nA CAPAN (Capacity analysis) study has been planned in both ACCs, starting at the end of 2022, results will be available at the end of Summer 2023, and capacity should be increased before Summer 2024​.\nShort-term ATFCM measures and what-if scenarios: in 2023, Skyguide implemented fully coordinated flow based measures between both centres Geneva and Zurich. It allows to diminish delay avoiding regulations when we observe excess of demand over short-period of time and allows to increase flight efficiency when we have a capacity surplus and we can relieve RAD constraints (offering greener trajectories)​.\nIncrease usage of CPDLC: the use of CPDLC is particularly scrutinized, simulations have been led to quantify the possible benefits. Within the course of 2023, analyses will be led to determine to which extent some of the CPDLC performance enhancement impacts could be harvested through an increase of sector capacity.\nFinally, Skyguide will launch a trial in Summer 2023 with a new tool to detect more precisely the impact of adverse weather conditions on the required temporary decrease of sector capacity.\n\n\nSummary of capacity performance\nSwitzerland did not achieve the required en route capacity performance in 2022. There were 1 042k flights in the airspace of Switzerland, with 242k minutes of ATFM en route delay attributed to Skyguide after the NM post operations delay attribution process.\nThere were an additional 111k minutes of en route ATFM delay originating from Skyguide that were re-attributed to DFS (&gt;49k) and DSNA (&gt;61k) via the NM post operations delay attribution process, according to the NMB agreement for eNM/S22 measures, to ameliorate capacity shortfalls in both Karlsruhe UAC and Reims ACC."

The Actual Unit Cost (AUC) reflects the cost per service unit, at which the service has actually been provided during the year.\nThe monitoring of the DUC / AUC is carried out in national currency in real terms, at 2017 prices.\n\n\nEn route actual unit cost (AUC) vs. en route determined unit cost (DUC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFocus on en route DUC monitoring at charging zone level\n\n\n\nAUC vs. DUC\n\nIn 2022, the en route AUC was +2.1% (or +2.36 CHF2017, +2.12 €2017) higher than the planned DUC. This results from the combination of lower than planned TSUs (-3.1%) and lower than planned en route costs in real terms (-1.1%, or -2.0 MCHF2017, -1.8 M€2017). It should be noted that actual inflation index in 2022 was +2.9 p.p. higher than planned.\n\nEn route service units\n\nThe difference between actual and planned TSUs (-3.1%) falls outside the ±2% dead band, but does not exceed the ±10% threshold foreseen in the traffic risk sharing mechanism. The resulting loss of en route revenues is therefore shared between the ANSP and the airspace users, with the ANSP (Skyguide) bearing a loss of -3.3 M€2017.\n\nEn route costs by entity\n\nActual real en route costs are -1.1% (-1.8 M€2017) lower than planned. This is the result of lower costs for the main ANSP, Skyguide (-1.9%, or -2.8 M€2017) and higher costs for the MET service provider (+2.7%, or +0.2 M€2017), and the NSA/EUROCONTROL (+6.8%, or +0.8 M€2017).\n\nEn route costs for the main ANSP (Skyguide) at charging zone level\n\nActual en route costs in real terms are lower than planned for Skyguide in 2022 (-1.9%, or -2.8 M€2017). However, the differences by nature of costs are distorted by two factors:\n\nThe overall reported costs in each cost item are netted by the financing of the services provided by Skyguide outside the Swiss FIR;\nSkyguide’s costs include significant amounts linked to the additional costs caused by the change in the capitalisation rule in 2022 (+14.9 M€2017). However, in order for this amount not to be billed to airspace users, it has also been reported as negative exceptional item in the determined costs, but not in the actual costs (-100% of negative exceptional costs, or +14.9 M€2017).\n\n\nthe significant difference in staff costs (which is overall of -€17.5 M€2017 or -14.7%), can be mainly explained by the evolution of the FTEs and salary assumptions, but it is also due to a reimbursement from the pension fund, although partially offset by the provision for ATCO retirement age transition costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonitoring of the en route actual unit cost for users (AUCU) at charging zone level\nThe Actual Unit Cost for Users(AUCU) reflects the price per service units that is charged in fine to users for the services provided in the year. It corresponds to the sum of the DUC for the year and of the different adjustments stemming from that year. The monitoring of the AUCU is carried out in national currency in nominal terms.\n\n\nEn route actual unit cost for users (AUCU) at charging zone level\n\n\n\n* The traffic adjustment on adjustments is not considered to avoid double counting, as the related adjustments have already been taken into account in full in the AUCU for the current year or previous years.** The difference in revenue due to the application of the temporary unit rates in 2022, if applicable, is already reflected in the DUC (part to be charged retroactively) and is therefore not considered in the total adjustments, in order to avoid double counting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEn route costs exempt from cost sharing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: These data are taken from the June 2023 en route Reporting Tables (for Eurocontrol costs and costs of competent authorities and qualified entities) and from the “NSA Report on the verification of cost risk sharing for the year 2022” submitted in accordance with Article 28 (7) of Regulation (EU) 2019/317 (for ANSPs costs).\n\n\nEn route regulatory result at charging zone level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** before deduction of other revenues, as is the case for the regulatory results (see items 10 to 14)\n\n\n\n\nFocus on en route AUCU monitoring at charging zone level\nThe actual en route unit cost incurred by airspace users (AUCU) in respect of activities performed in 2022 (108.42 CHF or 107.89 €) is -6.6% lower than the nominal DUC (116.08 CHF or 115.51 €). The difference between these two figures (-7.66 CHF/SU or -7.62 €/SU) is due to:\n\nthe positive inflation adjustment resulting from higher than planned inflation (+2.66 CHF/SU or +2.65 €/SU);\nthe impact of adjustments resulting from the costs exempted from cost-sharing mechanism (-1.42 CHF/SU or -1.41 €/SU);\nthe addition of the traffic risk sharing adjustments (+0.81 CHF/SU or +0.80 €/SU);\nthe addition of the traffic adjustment (+0.44 CHF/SU or +0.43 €/SU) for the costs not subject to traffic risk sharing; and\napplication of a lower unit rate as foreseen in Art. 29(6) in year 2022 (-10.15 CHF/SU or -10.10 €/SU).\n\nThe share of the regulatory result (see items 10 to 14) in the AUCU (before the deduction of other revenues) is -0.7%."

Also, it does not take into account any opportunity cost.\nThe RR, when expressed in percentage of the revenues, can be associated to a “margin” generated by the ANSP with respect to the activity of the year, but it is not comparable to the margin that would be calculated straight from ANSPs financial statements.\n\nEx-ante, the RR is equal to the RoE (in value) included in the determined cost of capital.\nEx-post, the RR is the sum of the RoE (in value) in the actual cost of capital and the net gain/loss resulting from risk sharing and incentives generated from that year.\n\nThe net gain/loss calculated in box 11 results from the combination of three distinct items: a) the outcome of the cost-sharing mechanism to be retained by the ANSP (including the impact of costs exempted from cost-sharing and of the inflation adjustment); b) the outcome of the traffic risk sharing mechanism; and c) the outcome of the financial incentive mechanism for capacity and environment targets (not applicable for 2022).\nThe monitoring of the RR is carried out in national currency in nominal terms.\nNote 1: Ex-post RR does not take into account the application of the lower unit rate as per Art. 29.6 in 2022. This application generated losses of -3.5 MCHF for entities providing services in the terminal charging zone (-0.8 MCHF for skyguide and -2.7 MCHF for MET SP).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkyguide net gain on activity in the Switzerland terminal charging zone in the year 2022\n\nSkyguide reported a net gain of +3.6 MCHF, as a combination of a gain of +7.0 MCHF arising from the cost sharing mechanism, with a loss of -3.4 MCHF arising from the traffic risk sharing mechanism.\n\nSkyguide overall regulatory results (RR) for the terminal activity\n\nEx-post, the overall RR taking into account the net gain from the terminal activity mentioned above (+3.6 MCHF) and the actual RoE (+3.0 MCHF) amounts to +6.6 MCHF (6.7% of the terminal revenues). The resulting ex-post rate of return on equity is 14.6%, which is higher than the 12.9% planned in the PP. See also Note 1 above."

    "text": "3.1 En route\n\nMinutes of ATFM en-route delay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations The value for en route ATFM delay per flight presented here is subsequent to the NM post operations delay attribution process.\n\n\n\n\nNSA’s assessment of capacity performance\n2022 en route capacity target set in the Swiss National performance plan was just not met for 2022 (total ATFM-Delay per flight : 0.21 min/fl., 0.02 min. above the target). The delay in 2022 was mainly caused by severe adverse weather conditions above the Alps, limited ATC capacity and to a lesser extent, staffing.\nHigh uncertainty on traffic recovery over medium term horizon (2-3 months), new traffic patterns and increased volatility had also an aggravating impact during the Summer period.\nIn 2022, Skyguide just missed its total en-route ATFM delay per flight. The main cause of delays were Weather (45%), ATC-Capacity (32%), Staffing (8%), Equipment (ATC) (7%), Other (6%) and Special Event (1%).\nBefore applying the post-ops adjustment process, the total en-route ATFM delay per flight reached 0.34 min / flight whereas the CRSTMP En-route ATFM delay per flight reached 0.15 min / flight as shown in the Capacity Report of the FABEC. After applying the post-ops adjustment process and re-attributing respectively 61 357 min to DSNA and 49 178 min to DFS according to the NM data, skyguide reached 0.21 for the total en-route ATFM delay per flight and 0.11 for the CRSTMP part.\nThe main cause of delay was weather. As Skyguide is in charge of air traffic control in the centre of the Alps, it is a lot more subject to strong adverse weather conditions than the major part of all the other ANSPs.\nAs a basis for comparison, the NM includes approximately 15% of delay due to Weather in its delay forecast. The fact that heavy CB situation begins to occur in May until September is obviously an aggravating factor as it happens exactly at the same time as the yearly peak of traffic demand, which has a tremendous impact on delays.\n\n\nMonitoring process for capacity performance\nThe monitoring for en-route capacity performance is carried out under the auspices of the FABEC Financial and Performance Committee (FPC), counterpart of the European Commission at the States side, consulting and reporting to FABEC Council as appropriate.\nOn a monthly basis and through the AFG/PMG (ANSP FABEC Group / Performance Management Group) the ANSPs collectively submit a report to the FPC, based on PRU available data, consolidated and analysed, on their joint progress in achieving the national target set and reference or indicative values and on the results and analysis of the en- route capacity achievement.\nIn case the national target set and/or the annual/reference values are threatened not to be met, AFG/PMG is asked to propose to FPC possible corrective measures which the ANSPs determine fit to react to the weaker performance at national and/or ACC level, in order to remedy the situation.\nThe FPC analyses the reports, assesses the actions considered by the ANSPs together with the necessity of appropriate measures to be taken by the States or the NSAs and makes an advice to the proposals, made by the AFG/PMG, to the FABEC Council for such appropriate measures, after consultation with the AFG/PMG. The potential corrective measures take into account the seriousness of the risk of not meeting the targets set and/or the annual/reference values.\nThe FPC is also responsible for the management of the Capacity KPA financial incentive schemes. This monitoring process is described in the FABEC FPC States Performance Process description, regularly updated.\nThe Swiss NSA has periodical meetings with its ANSPs. - The Swiss NSA is regularly provided with various reports, analysis and data such as FABEC monthly capacity reports (including Skyguide data), Skyguide reports, PRU dashboards which enable to closely monitor the performance evolution.\n\n\nCapacity Planning\nA NOP Recovery Plan process was initiated and launched by the Network Manager and its first edition was published on 30 April 2020, as European traffic began a slow recovery from its lowest point of just 2,099 flights across the network on 12 April 2020.\nSince then a weekly Rolling NOP, published every Friday has been introduced through which NM coordinates with all partners to ensure capacity is available at ACCs and in the airspace they manage, and on the ground at airports, to meet the expected traffic demand from the airlines on each day of the next six weeks enabling to coordinate all operational stakeholders throughout the pandemic to ensure that network actors can plan their recovery effectively based on predicted traffic levels.\nOn 6th May 2022, a first version of the new 2022-2026 NOP has been released (still based on the STATFOR forecast published in October 2021 as STATFOR has postponed the publication of its new forecast to October 2022). It included the capacity planning for skyguide with the latest available capacity information and remedial measures for all ACCs concerned by capacity issues.\nSkyguide is of course part of this process and contributes to the provision for a consolidated European network view of the evolution of the air traffic, enabling the planning of the service delivered in the recovery phase to match the expected air traffic demand in a safe, efficient and coordinated manner. However, the 10% capacity buffer requested by the NM, the recommendation for zero delay and the continuous optimistic traffic forecast selected have naturally an adverse impact on ANSPs finance.\nSkyguide implemented the cross-border airspace restructuring with Reims ACC and Basel APP, improved ATFCM procedures and STAM as well as the CDM procedures for Airspace requests level 2 and 3 (ASM - ATFCM), its optimized sector opening scheme to match the traffic demand, network weather mitigation measures, the FABEC airspace structure and implemented the FRA CH.\nIn parallel, Skyguide continued to develop its top priority programme: the Virtual Centre; in addition, Crystal, the traffic and complexity prediction tool is continuously improved.\n\n\nATCO in OPS (FTE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication of Corrective Measures for Capacity (if applicable)\nA CAPAN (Capacity analysis) study has been planned in both ACCs, starting at the end of 2022, results will be available at the end of Summer 2023, and capacity should be increased before Summer 2024​.\nShort-term ATFCM measures and what-if scenarios: in 2023, Skyguide implemented fully coordinated flow based measures between both centres Geneva and Zurich. It allows to diminish delay avoiding regulations when we observe excess of demand over short-period of time and allows to increase flight efficiency when we have a capacity surplus and we can relieve RAD constraints (offering greener trajectories)​.\nIncrease usage of CPDLC: the use of CPDLC is particularly scrutinized, simulations have been led to quantify the possible benefits. Within the course of 2023, analyses will be led to determine to which extent some of the CPDLC performance enhancement impacts could be harvested through an increase of sector capacity.\nFinally, Skyguide will launch a trial in Summer 2023 with a new tool to detect more precisely the impact of adverse weather conditions on the required temporary decrease of sector capacity.\n\n\nSummary of capacity performance\nSwitzerland did not achieve the required en route capacity performance in 2022. There were 1 042k flights in the airspace of Switzerland, with 242k minutes of ATFM en route delay attributed to Skyguide after the NM post operations delay attribution process.\nThere were an additional 111k minutes of en route ATFM delay originating from Skyguide that were re-attributed to DFS (&gt;49k) and DSNA (&gt;61k) via the NM post operations delay attribution process, according to the NMB agreement for eNM/S22 measures, to ameliorate capacity shortfalls in both Karlsruhe UAC and Reims ACC."
