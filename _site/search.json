A direct comparison with maturity levels and scoring of EoSM used RP2 is not advisable.\n\n\nObservations\nFour out of five EoSM components of the ANSP meet the RP3 target level. No improvements were observed over 2022, but only “Safety Risk Management” component is below RP3 target level with three questions to improve during RP3 to achieve RP3 target.\nIMPORTANT: EASA/European Commission did not receive the verified questionnaire from the NSA on time. This is an important step to receive confirmation that the self-evaluated questionnaire by the ANSP has been actually verified. It should be sent in due time to allow proper and timely drafting of the Monitoring Report."

(-0,22 below the target), and there were all attributed to weather reasons, mostly in the winter months. Finland reports that there was no impact of the Russian’s war on terminal capacity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe national target on arrival ATFM delay in 2022 was met.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelsinki’s ATFM slot compliance was 95.6 %. With regard to the 4.4% of flights that did not adhere, 0.8% was early and 3.6% was late.\n\n\n\n\n\nATC pre-departure delay at Helsinki (EFHK: 2022: 0.21 min/dep) is still below the pre-pandemic value (0.39 min/dep)\n\n\n\nThe total (all causes) delay in the actual off block time at Helsinki increased slightly in 2022 (EFHK: 2020: 7.76 min/dep.; 2021: 11.07 min/dep.; 2022: 11.46 min/dep.). The highest delays per flight were observed in January and December."

The war in Ukraine; the closure of Russian airspace; and banning Russian airlines from flying in Finnish airspace, had a huge impact in traffic.\nAs a result of the sanctions, all European airlines stopped flying to Asia completely over Finland. In general, overflying traffic was around 60 % of the level of 2019. Finnair, the biggest customer to Fintraffic ANS, was forced to change its strategy after the end of Russian overflights to Asia. Traffic to Kaliningrad increased over the international waters between Estonia and Finland. This traffic increase can be noticed in the number of operations but its impact in terms of service units is less.\nFinland reached the capacity targets in both KPIs, en-route and terminal. En-route delays have been zero in many years, and the capacity provided for this is due to user demand for as few delays as possible.\nThe en-route overflying traffic between Europe and Asia has dropped dramatically due to the war and the related airspace closure, and has resulted to continuation of some of the temporary staff lay-offs.\n\n\nMonitoring process for capacity performance\nReview of the actual values from the NM dashboard.\n\n\nCapacity Planning\nEn-route ATFM delay will remain low as the capacity is delivered due to user demand.\n\n\nATCO in OPS (FTE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication of Corrective Measures for Capacity (if applicable)\nThere are changes in traffic flows/patterns: airspace closures have shifted the traffic flows from Russia to Kaliningrad, and these flights have to use the narrow international airspace corridor between Finland and Estonia, and can not use the direct routing that has been used before the war. There is an average of 350 flights per week.\nAlso the flights from Europe to Asia are not overflying Finnish airspace anymore because of the airspace closure.\nAnother change is in the flights between Finland (Helsinki) and Japan, where our main operator Finnair flies daily. These flights can’t fly the most direct route anymore because of the airspace closure, and have to fly via northern route above the North Pole.\nThese changes do not affect the en route capacity performance, but still need to be taken into account when assessing the overall performance of the ANSP.\n\n\nSummary of capacity performance\nFinland experienced an increase in traffic from 123k flights in 2021, to 205k flights in 2022; again, with zero ATFM delay. However, traffic levels were still substantially below the 285k flights in 2019."

The Actual Unit Cost (AUC) reflects the cost per service unit, at which the service has actually been provided during the year.\nThe monitoring of the DUC / AUC is carried out in national currency in real terms, at 2017 prices.\n\n\nEn route actual unit cost (AUC) vs. en route determined unit cost (DUC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFocus on en route DUC monitoring at charging zone level\n\n\n\nAUC vs. DUC\n\nIn 2022, the en route AUC was +26.0% (or +12.62 €2017) higher than the planned DUC. This results from the combination of significantly lower than planned TSUs (-33.1%) and significantly lower than planned en route costs in real terms (-15.8%, or -6.9 M€2017). It should be noted that actual inflation index in 2022 was +6.7 p.p. higher than planned.\n\nEn route service units\n\nThe difference between actual and planned TSUs (-33.1%) falls outside the ±10% threshold foreseen in the traffic risk sharing mechanism. The resulting loss of en route revenues is therefore shared between the ANSP and the airspace users, with the ANSP (Fintraffic ANS) bearing a loss of -1.5 M€2017.\n\nEn route costs by entity\n\nActual real en route costs are -15.8% (-6.9 M€2017) lower than planned. This is the result of lower costs for the main ANSP, Fintraffic ANS (-17.7%, or -6.6 M€2017), the MET service provider (-9.1%, or -0.2 M€2017) and the NSA/EUROCONTROL (-1.5%, or -0.1 M€2017).\n\nEn route costs for the main ANSP (Fintraffic ANS) at charging zone level\n\nSignificantly lower than planned en route costs in real terms for Fintraffic ANS in 2022 (-17.7%, or -6.6 M€2017) result from:\n\nSignificantly lower staff costs (-16.9%) resulting from cost-savings (temporary lay-offs, lower head count, abandoning bonuses, lower pension costs, postponing recruiting, etc.) introduced to compensate for significantly lower than planned traffic due to the war in Ukraine;\nSignificantly lower other operating costs (-15.3%) due to cost-savings in many cost categories (Group service fees, training, travel, telecommunication costs, etc.);\nSignificantly lower depreciation (-23.9%) and cost of capital (-41.1%) resulting from postponed investments; and,\nSignificantly lower deduction for VFR exempted flights (-5.9%).\n\nNote: It is understood that the relevant figures for 2022 will be slightly updated in the Monitoring Report 2023 following the correction of 2022 actual costs in the November 2023 reporting tables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonitoring of the en route actual unit cost for users (AUCU) at charging zone level\nThe Actual Unit Cost for Users(AUCU) reflects the price per service units that is charged in fine to users for the services provided in the year. It corresponds to the sum of the DUC for the year and of the different adjustments stemming from that year. The monitoring of the AUCU is carried out in national currency in nominal terms.\n\n\nEn route actual unit cost for users (AUCU) at charging zone level\n\n\n\n* The traffic adjustment on adjustments is not considered to avoid double counting, as the related adjustments have already been taken into account in full in the AUCU for the current year or previous years.** The difference in revenue due to the application of the temporary unit rates in 2022, if applicable, is already reflected in the DUC (part to be charged retroactively) and is therefore not considered in the total adjustments, in order to avoid double counting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEn route costs exempt from cost sharing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: These data are taken from the June 2023 en route Reporting Tables (for Eurocontrol costs and costs of competent authorities and qualified entities) and from the “NSA Report on the verification of cost risk sharing for the year 2022” submitted in accordance with Article 28 (7) of Regulation (EU) 2019/317 (for ANSPs costs).\n\n\nEn route regulatory result at charging zone level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** before deduction of other revenues, as is the case for the regulatory results (see items 10 to 14)\n\n\n\n\nFocus on en route AUCU monitoring at charging zone level\nThe actual en route unit cost incurred by airspace users (AUCU) in respect of activities performed in 2022 (68.04 €) is +33.7% higher than the nominal DUC (50.89 €). The difference between these two figures (+17.16 €/SU) is due to:\n\nthe positive inflation adjustment resulting from higher than planned inflation (+3.93 €/SU);\nthe impact of adjustments resulting from the costs exempted from cost-sharing mechanism (-2.06 €/SU);\nthe addition of the traffic risk sharing adjustments (+18.73 €/SU);\nthe addition of the traffic adjustment (+3.60 €/SU) for the costs not subject to traffic risk sharing; and,\nthe deduction of the other revenues (-7.05 €/SU).\n\nThe share of the regulatory result (see items 10 to 14) in the AUCU (before the deduction of other revenues) is 11.7%."
