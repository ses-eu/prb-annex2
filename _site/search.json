As a follow-up to the events in Ukraine, reciprocal bans have been imposed on the use of EU airspace by Russian aircraft and on the use of Russian Federation airspace by European aircraft. These actions led to a significant extension of the flight time for some destinations (mainly from/to the Far East and the aggregate flow from/to Other ICAO regions in Asia) and to the shift of non-traditional traffic to the Bulgarian airspace. BULATSA carried out the necessary preparations in a timely manner and successfully dealt with the increased air traffic over Bulgaria by developing sector configurations to handle the traffic and providing the necessary number of air traffic controllers. The number of serviced aircraft was 832,923, which is a increase of 58% compared to the previous year but was still below (~ 6.5%) the pre-pandemic 2019.The reported delay figure for Bulgaria in 2022 is 0.00.\n\n\nMonitoring process for capacity performance\nMonitoring of capacity performance is effected through regular monitoring of the minutes of delay generated, based on the information provided by NM. Monitoring is done on a monthly basis.\n\n\nCapacity Planning\nCapacity planning is done on a network level as part of the capacity planning processes established by NM. Additionally, BULATSA has established internal capacity planning which is based on the traffic forecast produced by STATFOR, but also based on the internally produced traffic forecasts, which take into account local specifics. The capacity planning process includes: • HR availability and rostering, both in long term ( new ATCO hiring and training) , but also in the medium ( seasonal) and short term (monthly). HR requirements are assessed and measures are taken to re-prioritize available resources during the busy periods.• Medium and long term planning of capacity availability based on technological improvements, introduction of SESAR innovations, system upgrades• Airspace changes, sectorization and development of interfaces with adjacent FIRs. The issues and plans are regularly reviewed and reassess in relation to current operational environment and forecasts. A Capacity Management Board is established internally that convenes once a month in order to discuss the latest information and trends. The Capacity Board includes a broad range of experts ( technical, operational, financial and legal) in order to ensure that multidisciplinary approach to capacity is undertaken.War in Ukraine As a response to the situation, BULATSA introduced the utilization of new airspace configurations ( now the lateral split of Sofia east sectors is actively used). A new organization of the interfaces with Turkey were agreed and will be implemented for Summer 2023. Cross training between sector cluster was initiated and successfully completed to allow for more flexibility in the human resources re-allocation. Meetings were carried out with major airspace users ( Turkish Airlines) to review flight planning practices and agree on some traffic flow initiatives. Administrative staff with operational competence was reallocated for the peak traffic periods. At the same time, BULATSA has continued the work on key technological projects (rostering system, complexity management system, ATM system) in order to ensure that capacity will be improved in the medium and long term.\n\n\nATCO in OPS (FTE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication of Corrective Measures for Capacity (if applicable)\nNil\n\n\nSummary of capacity performance\nBulgaria experienced an increase in traffic from 516k flights in 2021 to 822k flights in 2022, with zero ATFM delay. However, traffic levels were still substantially below the 879k flights in 2019. Although traffic levels were still below 2019 on an annual basis, over the second half of 2022 the number of flights were quite close to 2019, and in some cases exceeded the 2019 summer peaks."

    "text": "4.1 En route charging zone\n\nContextual economic information: en route air navigation services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonitoring of the en route determined unit cost (DUC) at charging zone level\nThe Determined Unit Cost (DUC) is the cost per service unit, at which the service is planned to be provided during the year. The Actual Unit Cost (AUC) reflects the cost per service unit, at which the service has actually been provided during the year.The monitoring of the DUC / AUC is carried out in national currency in real terms, at 2017 prices.\n\n\nEn route actual unit cost (AUC) vs. en route determined unit cost (DUC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFocus on en route DUC monitoring at charging zone level\n\n\n\nAUC vs. DUC\n\nIn 2022, the en route AUC was -25.1% (or -16.99 BGN2017, -8.69 €2017) lower than the planned DUC. This results from the combination of significantly higher than planned TSUs (+24.5%) and significantly lower than planned en route costs in real terms (-6.8%, or -14.3 MBGN2017, -7.3 M€2017). It should be noted that actual inflation index in 2022 was +14.1 p.p. higher than planned.\n\nEn route service units\n\nThe difference between actual and planned TSUs (+24.5%) falls outside the ±10% threshold foreseen in the traffic risk sharing mechanism. The resulting gain of additional en route revenues is therefore shared between the ANSP and the airspace users, with the ANSP (BULATSA) retaining an amount of +3.6 M€2017.\n\nEn route costs by entity\n\nActual real en route costs are -6.8% (-7.3 M€2017) lower than planned. This is the result higher than planned inflation with a significant impact on costs for the main ANSP, BULATSA (-6.5%, or -6.4 M€2017) and the NSA/EUROCONTROL (-10.8%, or -0.9 M€2017).\n\nEn route costs for the main ANSP (BULATSA) at charging zone level\n\nSignificantly lower than planned en route costs in real terms for BULATSA in 2022 (-6.5%, or -6.4 M€2017) result mainly from a higher than planned inflation:- Significantly lower than planned staff costs (-8.6%) in real terms but higher in nominal terms (+3.1%), reported to be due to “BULATSA normalising levels of payment in line with traffic levels increase and in response to high inflation in Bulgaria over 2022 (&gt;15% on a monthly roll-over basis)”;- Significantly lower than planned other operating costs (-19.4%), reported to be mainly due to “lower than expected impairment of receivables, lower mission and training costs, etc”;- Significantly higher than planned depreciation costs (+11.7%), reported to be due to “BULATSA continued fulfilment of all critically important investments and commissioned assets”;- Higher cost of capital (+1.2%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonitoring of the en route actual unit cost for users (AUCU) at charging zone level\nThe Actual Unit Cost for Users(AUCU) reflects the price per service units that is charged in fine to users for the services provided in the year. It corresponds to the sum of the DUC for the year and of the different adjustments stemming from that year. The monitoring of the AUCU is carried out in national currency in nominal terms.\n\n\nEn route actual unit cost for users (AUCU) at charging zone level\n\n\n\n* The traffic adjustment on adjustments is not considered to avoid double counting, as the related adjustments have already been taken into account in full in the AUCU for the current year or previous years.** The difference in revenue due to the application of the temporary unit rates in 2022, if applicable, is already reflected in the DUC (part to be charged retroactively) and is therefore not considered in the total adjustments, in order to avoid double counting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEn route costs exempt from cost sharing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: These data are taken from the June 2023 en route Reporting Tables (for Eurocontrol costs and costs of competent authorities and qualified entities) and from the “NSA Report on the verification of cost risk sharing for the year 2022” submitted in accordance with Article 28 (7) of Regulation (EU) 2019/317 (for ANSPs costs).\n\n\nEn route regulatory result at charging zone level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** before deduction of other revenues, as is the case for the regulatory results (see items 10 to 14)\n\n\n\n\nFocus on en route AUCU monitoring at charging zone level\nThe actual en route unit cost incurred by airspace users (AUCU) in respect of activities performed in 2022 (64.73 BGN or 33.11 €) is -10.3% lower than the nominal DUC (72.16 BGN or 36.90 €). The difference between these two figures (-7.42 BGN/SU or -3.80 €/SU) is due to:- the positive inflation adjustment resulting from higher than planned inflation (+5.41 BGN/SU or +2.77 €/SU);- the impact of adjustments resulting from the costs exempted from cost-sharing mechanism (-0.07 BGN/SU or -0.04 €/SU);- the deduction of the traffic risk sharing adjustments (-10.28 BGN/SU or -5.26 €/SU);- the deduction of the traffic adjustment (-1.66 BGN/SU or -0.85 €/SU) for the costs not subject to traffic risk sharing; and- the deduction of the other revenues (-0.82 BGN/SU or -0.42 €/SU).The share of the regulatory result (see items 10 to 14) in the AUCU (before the deduction of other revenues) is 20.0%."
