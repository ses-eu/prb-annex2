The ANSP did not meet the set CAP target due to the significant increase of traffic in LDZO ACC where actual traffic was 42% higher than planned in the RP3 Performance plan. As a consequence, limitations occurred during summer season due to unplanned high increase of traffic demand in peak hours.Croatian Civil Aviation Agency has established an agreement with CroControl ltd. to convene bianually as part of the performance monitoring process. If the need is determined, a meeting can be organized to discuss the identified issues and/or discrepancies. Croatian Civil Aviation Agency identifyed the factors that directly affected the increase in minutes of delay compared to what was planned in the performance plan. Recognized factors are:1. Traffic Levels – The target delay values were determined based on STATFOR’s traffic forecast from May 2021, specifically the Base scenario. According to that specific forecast, Croatia was expected to have 501,000 flights in 2022. However, EUROCONTROL’s NOP document (2022-2026) considered the STATFOR forecast from October 2021, which indicated that it was realistic to anticipate traffic levels higher than the High scenario of traffic demand. In other words, Croatia was projected to have approximately 700,000 flights. By the end of 2022, CroControl Ltd. recorded over 700,000 flights, which represents a 40% increase in traffic compared to the forecasted levels at the time when the performance plan targets were established.Furthermore, the South-East Axis stands out as a transportation corridor that experienced the swiftest and most significant recovery of traffic at the European level following the COVID restrictions. This can be exemplified by comparing traffic levels in 2019 with those in 2022. According to data from the Aviation Intelligence Portal, Croatia had only 1,000 fewer flights in 2022 compared to 2019.2. Number of Available ATCOs – In August 2022, there was an unexpected departure of controllers due to eight resignations classified as extraordinary. Additionally, one individual requested to cease working in operations for personal reasons. 3. Priority of Training for new ATCOs – CroControl Ltd. places high priority on the training of controllers. Consequently, during the summer season, eight ATCO instructors were assigned to provide simulator training to new controllers as part of the ATCO TO program.\n\n\nMonitoring process for capacity performance\nMonitoring of all available KPI’s and PI’s is done through the Single European Sky Data Portal which is considered as the main source of information.In the year 2022 there were significant challenges for LDZO ACC capacity KPI as the actual traffic was 42% higher than planned in the RP3 Performance plan while summer season traffic was 4% above historical highest year (2019). As a consequence, limitations occurred during summer season due to unplanned high increase of traffic demand in peak hours.\n\n\nCapacity Planning\nCapacity planning is done in line with NM’s initiative for development of a rolling NOP document in which short-term capacity and demand on the Network level is described. The expected traffic outlook is given for eight weeks ahead and revised weekly, while capacity is adapted to traffic demand and reported to NM which assesses the efficiency for planned period. In the planning process on local level, several departments are involved in strategic and tactical development of the plan.\n\n\nATCO in OPS (FTE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication of Corrective Measures for Capacity (if applicable)\nThe shortage of air traffic controllers is a recognized problem that is being continuously addressed. Sector capacities and available staff have been communicated with the Network Manager, and on a daily basis, additional management of available capacities is carried out to optimize the utilization of resources to the fullest extent possible.CroControl ltd. has re-evaluated its sector capacities in late 2022 in order to optimize available resources. The new sector capacity values have been in effect since March 6, 2023.Furthermore, CroControl ltd. continuously improves its ATS system, staff training, and sharing of best practices which has resulted in significantly more efficient utilization of existing capacities. This is evidenced by comparing traffic and delays in June and July 2022 to the same period in 2019. In late 2022, a refreshment course for FMP personnel was conducted, and in 2023, CroControl ltd., in collaboration with EUROCONTROL, has agreed to share best practices in preparation for the summer period.\n\n\nSummary of capacity performance\nCroatia experienced an increase in traffic from 461k flights in 2021 to 713k flights in 2021, compared to 714k flights in 2019. Actions taken and results of improved capacity performance are visible in the handling of traffic during June 2022. In June 2022 Croatia had 24k minutes of ATFM delay while handling more than 80k flights.For comparison in June 2019 approximately 79k flights resulted in around 97k minutes of delay."

The Actual Unit Cost (AUC) reflects the cost per service unit, at which the service has actually been provided during the year.The monitoring of the DUC / AUC is carried out in national currency in real terms, at 2017 prices.\n\n\n3 En route actual unit cost (AUC) vs. en route determined unit cost (DUC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Focus on en route DUC monitoring at charging zone level\n\n\n\nAUC vs. DUC\n\nIn 2022, the en route AUC was -35.7% (or -142.04 HRK2017, -19.04 €2017) lower than the planned DUC. This results from the combination of significantly higher than planned TSUs (+40.9%) and significantly lower than planned en route costs in real terms (-9.4%, or -59.1 MHRK2017, -7.9 M€2017). It should be noted that actual inflation index in 2022 was +12.1 p.p. higher than planned.\n\nEn route service units\n\nThe difference between actual and planned TSUs (+40.9%) falls outside the ±10% threshold foreseen in the traffic risk sharing mechanism. The resulting gain of additional en route revenues is therefore shared between the ANSP and the airspace users, with the ANSP (Croatia Control) retaining an amount of +2.8 M€2017.\n\nEn route costs by entity\n\nActual real en route costs are -9.4% (-7.9 M€2017) lower than planned. This is the result of lower costs for the main ANSP, Croatia Control (-10.2%, or -8.0 M€2017) and higher costs for the NSA/EUROCONTROL (+1.1%, or +0.07 M€2017).\n\nEn route costs for the main ANSP (Croatia Control) at charging zone level\n\nSignificantly lower than planned en route costs in real terms for Croatia Control in 2022 (-10.2%, or -8.0 M€2017) result from:- Significantly lower staff costs (-12.3%), due to not fully realized recruitment plan. This result is also impacted by higher actual inflation index (+12.1 p.p.). - Significantly lower other operating costs (-7.5%), mainly due to inflation index impact (+12.1 p.p.) since in nominal terms other operating costs are higher than planned by 3.2%. - Significantly lower depreciation (-5.4%), due to lower than planned realization of capex due to logistic and production delays and decommissioning of some CC’s assets. - Lower cost of capital (-4.7%), due to lower than expected assets base. - Significantly lower deduction for VFR exempted flights (-11.8%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 Monitoring of the en route actual unit cost for users (AUCU) at charging zone level\nThe Actual Unit Cost for Users(AUCU) reflects the price per service units that is charged in fine to users for the services provided in the year. It corresponds to the sum of the DUC for the year and of the different adjustments stemming from that year. The monitoring of the AUCU is carried out in national currency in nominal terms.\n\n\n6 En route actual unit cost for users (AUCU) at charging zone level\n\n\n\n* The traffic adjustment on adjustments is not considered to avoid double counting, as the related adjustments have already been taken into account in full in the AUCU for the current year or previous years.** The difference in revenue due to the application of the temporary unit rates in 2022, if applicable, is already reflected in the DUC (part to be charged retroactively) and is therefore not considered in the total adjustments, in order to avoid double counting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 En route costs exempt from cost sharing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: These data are taken from the June 2023 en route Reporting Tables (for Eurocontrol costs and costs of competent authorities and qualified entities) and from the “NSA Report on the verification of cost risk sharing for the year 2022” submitted in accordance with Article 28 (7) of Regulation (EU) 2019/317 (for ANSPs costs).\n\n\n8 En route regulatory result at charging zone level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** before deduction of other revenues, as is the case for the regulatory results (see items 10 to 14)\n\n\n\n\n9 Focus on en route AUCU monitoring at charging zone level\nThe actual en route unit cost incurred by airspace users (AUCU) in respect of activities performed in 2022 (314.27 HRK or 41.73 €) is -23.6% lower than the nominal DUC (411.32 HRK or 54.61 €). The difference between these two figures (-97.05 HRK/SU or -12.89 €/SU) is due to:- the positive inflation adjustment resulting from higher than planned inflation (+26.19 HRK/SU or +3.48 €/SU);- the impact of adjustments resulting from the costs exempted from cost-sharing mechanism (+4.40 HRK/SU or +0.58 €/SU);- the deduction of the traffic risk sharing adjustments (-91.95 HRK/SU or -12.21 €/SU);- the deduction of the traffic adjustment (-16.33 HRK/SU or -2.17 €/SU) for the costs not subject to traffic risk sharing; and- the deduction of the other revenues (-19.35 HRK/SU or -2.57 €/SU).The share of the regulatory result (see items 10 to 13) in the AUCU (before the deduction of other revenues) is 18.4%."
