    "text": "4.1 En route charging zone\n\nContextual economic information: en route air navigation services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonitoring of the en route determined unit cost (DUC) at charging zone level\nThe Determined Unit Cost (DUC) is the cost per service unit, at which the service is planned to be provided during the year. The Actual Unit Cost (AUC) reflects the cost per service unit, at which the service has actually been provided during the year.\nThe monitoring of the DUC / AUC is carried out in national currency in real terms, at 2017 prices.\n\n\nEn route actual unit cost (AUC) vs. en route determined unit cost (DUC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFocus on en route DUC monitoring at charging zone level\n\n\n\nAUC vs. DUC\n\nIn 2022, the en route AUC was -3.1% (or -0.95 €2017) lower than the planned DUC. This results from the combination of significantly lower than planned en route costs in real terms (-5.7%, or -3.2 M€2017) and lower than planned TSUs (-2.7%). It should be noted that actual inflation index in 2022 was +2.9 p.p. higher than planned.\n\nEn route service units\n\nThe difference between actual and planned TSUs (-2.7%) falls outside the ±2% dead band, but does not exceed the ±10% threshold foreseen in the traffic risk sharing mechanism. The resulting loss of en route revenues is therefore shared between the ANSP and the airspace users, with the ANSP (DCAC Cyprus) bearing a loss of -0.8 M€2017).\n\nEn route costs by entity\n\nActual real en route costs are -5.7% (-3.2 M€2017) lower than planned. This is the result of lower costs for the main ANSP, DCAC Cyprus (-6.5%, or -2.5 M€2017), the MET service provider (-15.5%, or -0.6 M€2017) and the NSA/EUROCONTROL (-1.0%, or -0.2 M€2017).\n\nEn route costs for the main ANSP (DCAC Cyprus) at charging zone level\n\nSignificantly lower than planned en route costs in real terms for DCAC Cyprus in 2022 (-6.5%, or -2.5 M€2017) result from:\n\nLower staff costs (-2.6%) although in nominal terms there is no difference,\nSignificantly lower other operating costs (-9.5%) due to a delay in the operation of the new ACC building in Kokkinotrimithia,\nLower depreciation (-2.5%) resulting from lower than foreseen actual cost of two investments,\nSignificantly lower cost of capital (-23.1%) due to the postponement of pre-payments for investments planned to be implemented later than originally foreseen in the Performance Plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonitoring of the en route actual unit cost for users (AUCU) at charging zone level\nThe Actual Unit Cost for Users(AUCU) reflects the price per service units that is charged in fine to users for the services provided in the year. It corresponds to the sum of the DUC for the year and of the different adjustments stemming from that year. The monitoring of the AUCU is carried out in national currency in nominal terms.\n\n\nEn route actual unit cost for users (AUCU) at charging zone level\n\n\n\n* The traffic adjustment on adjustments is not considered to avoid double counting, as the related adjustments have already been taken into account in full in the AUCU for the current year or previous years.** The difference in revenue due to the application of the temporary unit rates in 2022, if applicable, is already reflected in the DUC (part to be charged retroactively) and is therefore not considered in the total adjustments, in order to avoid double counting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEn route costs exempt from cost sharing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: These data are taken from the June 2023 en route Reporting Tables (for Eurocontrol costs and costs of competent authorities and qualified entities) and from the “NSA Report on the verification of cost risk sharing for the year 2022” submitted in accordance with Article 28 (7) of Regulation (EU) 2019/317 (for ANSPs costs).\n\n\nEn route regulatory result at charging zone level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** before deduction of other revenues, as is the case for the regulatory results (see items 10 to 14)\n\n\n\n\nFocus on en route AUCU monitoring at charging zone level\nThe actual en route unit cost incurred by airspace users (AUCU) in respect of activities performed in 2022 (33.36 €) is +1.8% higher than the nominal DUC (32.76 €). The difference between these two figures (+0.60 €/SU) is due to:\n\nthe positive inflation adjustment resulting from higher than planned inflation (+0.60 €/SU);\nthe impact of adjustments resulting from the costs exempted from cost-sharing mechanism (-0.40 €/SU);\nthe addition of the traffic risk sharing adjustments (+0.11 €/SU); and\nthe addition of the traffic adjustment (+0.28 €/SU) for the costs not subject to traffic risk sharing to be charged in future years.\n\nThe share of the regulatory result (see items 10 to 14) in the AUCU (before the deduction of other revenues) is 5.9%."

For this reason, air traffic volatility is very high and traffic demand estimates (hence, ATM performance) can vary as a result of external factors. These factors are beyond the control of the ANSP and the State in general.\nFurthermore, geopolitical changes can significantly alter the air traffic flows, creating new hotspots and signigificant capacity constraints. As an example, the Russia - Ukraine conflict has removed a significant traffic flow (and associated revenue) to and from Cyprus. As another example, the categorisation, by EASA, of the Syrian airspace as “conflict zone” has eliminated traffic flows in the north-eastern part of Nicosia FIR. These flows were diverted to the south, saturating the west and south sectors of Nicosia ACC.\nCapacity performance improved significantly in 2022. However, air traffic demand in 2022 was still lower than the 2019 levels. In this respect, the 2022 results cannot be considered as an accurate indication of future trends.\n\n\nMonitoring process for capacity performance\nThe NSA has in place the “NSA procedure for the monitoring of ANS Performance”. According to this procedure, the NSA monitors at quarterly intervals the average minutes of enroute ATFM (Air Traffic Flow Management) delay per flight. Based on this, the NSA analyzes the trends and takes the necessary measures, if needed.\n\n\nCapacity Planning\nCapacity planning is done with the Network Manager and is consistent with the required performance.\nThe transfer to the new ACC, which is delayed and planned in late 2023 to mid 2024, is expected to be the source of air traffic delays, which however will be of temporary nature. As the transfer will be done during a low traffic period the effect on the European Network is not expected to be significant. Efforts will be made so that any operation related to the transfer i.e. shadowing operations will be kept to the absolute minimum level so not to absorb HR from the actual ops at the new ACC.\n\n\nATCO in OPS (FTE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication of Corrective Measures for Capacity (if applicable)\nNil\n\n\nSummary of capacity performance\nCyprus experienced an increase in traffic from 252k flights in 2021, to 344k flights in 2022, with practically zero ATFM delay. However, traffic levels were still substantially below the 411k flights in 2019."
