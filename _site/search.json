    "text": "Main PRB findings - 2022\n2022 was characterised by the post COVID-19 rebound of traffic, +52% compared to 2021, and the impacts on some of the SES Member States of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. Union-wide performance shows that a majority of ANSPs did not take the opportunity to prepare for the forecast traffic rebound by implementing the necessary and planned measures to provide capacity and improve environmental performance. This resulted in en route ATFM delays well above the tar-gets and contributed to horizontal flight inefficiency being the highest since 2016. The situation in Ukraine can only partially (and locally) explain these results. Neither does the drop in traffic due to COVID-19 pandemic explain this under performance, as ANSPs in total spent less than foreseen in their performance plans and, in any event, could recover the bulk of the foregone revenue in future years. On a positive note, safety management performance remained solid.",

The adjusted actual value is 1.19 minutes per flight higher than the Union-wide target.\n▪ 11 Member States did not achieve their local targets, indicating that most of the ANSPs did use the COVID-19 period to undertake the necessary initiatives to provide capacity to support the expected post-COVID-19 pandemic growth in traffic (as highlighted in last year PRB monitoring report).\n▪ Terminal capacity performance deteriorated compared to 2021, mostly due to disruptions and airport-related capacity problems. All-cause departure delays were at a stunning 19.03 minutes per flight.\n▪ Some ANSPs were not ready for the traffic recovery and network disruptions caused by sys-tem transitions. The impact of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine also had an adverse effect. If ANSPs cannot implement capacity improvement measures as planned, and/or can-not deploy new systems without major disruptions, 2023 is expected to show even higher delays.",

An additional gap of 2.7M€2017 originates from 2022 when States had revised their plans after the adoption of their 2022 unit rate.
