The actual en-route ATFM delay per flight of 0,01 min./flt. was significant below the national target set to 0,08 min./flt. Actual performance is so far in RP3 much better than set in the revised Performance Plan.\n\n\nMonitoring process for capacity performance\nNothing reported\n\n\nCapacity Planning\nNorway has been developing ATC capacity over years, and is in position to provide more capacity than the national reference values.The cost optimum capacity for en route delay per flight for Avinor ANS is between 0,18 min/flt. and 0,11 min/flt., but for the airspace users this would be unacceptable. This view is based on the fact that a large portion of the overall traffic is transition flights with little leeway in terms of delays. Based on consultation meetings with the airspace users and Avinor ANS during the en route delay is set to between 0,08 min./flt and 0,11 min./flt. in RP3.Avinor ANS has over the last years been increasing capacity, in order to being able to shift to new technology without major operational consequences for the airspace users.\n\n\nATCO in OPS (FTE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication of Corrective Measures for Capacity (if applicable)\nInitial drop in overflights estimated to around 20%. Some of the traffic have recovered since the initial phase. In general en route capacity has not been affected.\n\n\nSummary of capacity performance\nNorway experienced an increase in traffic from 376k flights in 2021, with zero ATFM delay, to 529k flights in 2022 - with marginal delay (3k minutes).Traffic levels were still below the 595k flights in 2019.",

It corresponds to the sum of the DUC for the year and of the different adjustments stemming from that year. The monitoring of the AUCU is carried out in national currency in nominal terms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* The traffic adjustment on adjustments is not considered to avoid double counting, as the related adjustments have already been taken into account in full in the AUCU for the current year or previous years.** The difference in revenue due to the application of the temporary unit rates in 2022, if applicable, is already reflected in the DUC (part to be charged retroactively) and is therefore not considered in the total adjustments, in order to avoid double counting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: These data are taken from the June 2023 terminal Reporting Tables (for Eurocontrol costs and costs of competent authorities and qualified entities) and from the “NSA Report on the verification of cost risk sharing for the year 2022” submitted in accordance with Article 28 (7) of Regulation (EU) 2019/317 (for ANSPs costs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** before deduction of other revenues, as is the case for the regulatory results (see items 10 to 14)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe actual terminal unit cost incurred by airspace users (AUCU) in respect of activities performed in 2022 (1 827.99 NOK or 181.06 €) is -8.5% lower than the nominal DUC (1 998.23 NOK or 197.92 €). The difference between these two figures (-170.24 NOK/SU or -16.86 €/SU) is due to:- the positive inflation adjustment resulting from higher than planned inflation (+90.73 NOK/SU or +8.99 €/SU);- the impact of adjustments resulting from the costs exempted from cost-sharing mechanism (+12.31 NOK/SU or +1.22 €/SU);- the deduction of the traffic risk sharing adjustments (-69.40 NOK/SU or -6.87 €/SU);- the deduction of the traffic adjustment (-3.09 NOK/SU or -0.31 €/SU) for the costs not subject to traffic risk sharing; and- application of a lower unit rate as foreseen in Art. 29(6) in year 2022 (-200.79 NOK/SU or -19.89 €/SU); andThe share of regulatory result (see items 10 to 14) in the AUCU (before the deduction of other revenues) is 3.9%.",
