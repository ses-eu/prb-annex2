In the year 2022, actual gate-to-gate ANS costs are -3.8% (-9.8 M€2017) lower than planned, as en route costs are lower than planned by -1.8 M€2017 and terminal costs are lower than planned by -8.0 M€2017.

The actual share of en route in gate-to-gate ANS costs (65.5%) is higher than planned in the PP for 2022 (63.7%).

For the ANSPs providing services in the en route and terminal charging zones of Switzerland covered by the SES performance scheme, the ex-post gate-to-gate regulatory result in 2022 amounts to +6.3 MCHF (-1.2 MCHF for en route and +7.5 MCHF for terminal - see boxes 10 to 14 for the detailed analysis at charging zones level), corresponding to 2.3% of gate-to-gate ANS revenues.

This is higher than the return planned for the year (2.2% of gate-to-gate revenues). See also Note 1 in items 10.
