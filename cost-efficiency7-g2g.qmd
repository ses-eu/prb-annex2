In the year 2022, actual gate-to-gate ANS costs are -14.9% (-9.0 M€2017) lower than planned, as en route costs are lower than planned by -6.9 M€2017 and terminal costs are lower than planned by -2.1 M€2017.

The actual share of en route in gate-to-gate ANS costs (71.2%) is slightly lower than planned in the PP for 2022 (71.9%).

For the ANSPs providing services in the en route and terminal charging zones of Finland covered by the SES performance scheme, the ex-post gate-to-gate regulatory result in 2022 amounts to +7.1 M€ (+5.2 M€ for en route and +1.9 M€ for terminal - see boxes 10 to 14 for the detailed analysis at charging zones level), corresponding to 12.0% of gate-to-gate ANS revenues.

This is higher than the return planned for the year (2.0% of gate-to-gate revenues).
