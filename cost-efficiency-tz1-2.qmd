## Terminal charging zone  - main ANSP (Austro Control)
### 10 Monitoring of the terminal ANSPs regulatory results (RR)
The **Regulatory Result (RR)** corresponds to the revenues generated by the activities of the year, that exceed the direct and indirect operating costs of an ANSP, and so provide for a reasonable return on assets to contribute towards necessary capital improvements. The notion of RR focuses on the ANSP results entitled to the ANS activity in the year. It is therefore different from the net accounting profit disclosed in ANSPs financial statements. Also, it does not take into account any opportunity cost.<br/>The RR, when expressed in percentage of the revenues, can be associated to a “margin” generated by the ANSP with respect to the activity of the year, but it is not comparable to the margin that would be calculated straight from ANSPs financial statements.<br/> - Ex-ante, the RR is equal to the RoE (in value) included in the determined cost of capital.<br/> - Ex-post, the RR is the sum of the RoE (in value) in the actual cost of capital and the net gain/loss resulting from risk sharing and incentives generated from that year.<br/>The **net gain/loss** calculated in box 11 results from the combination of three distinct items: a) the outcome of the cost-sharing mechanism to be retained by the ANSP (including the impact of costs exempted from cost-sharing and of the inflation adjustment); b) the outcome of the traffic risk sharing mechanism; and c) the outcome of the financial incentive mechanism for capacity and environment targets (not applicable for 2022). <br/>The monitoring of the RR is carried out in national currency in nominal terms.<br/>**<br/>Note 1:** Ex-ante and ex-post RoE are computed based on the notional gearing of 85% debt used in the Performance Plan for RP3. The actual  gearing of Austro Control should be reported.<br/>**Note 2:** The analysis presented in items 11 to 13 excludes MET services of Austro Control since MET data are disclosed separately in en route and terminal reporting tables.<br/>The regulatory result of Austro Control's MET services is shown in item 14.<br/>

<p style = "margin-bottom: 0px;">**Austro Control net gain on activity in the Austria terminal charging zone in the year 2022**</p>

Austro Control reported a net loss of -1.7 M€, as a combination of a gain of +0.1 M€ arising from the cost sharing mechanism, with a loss of -1.8 M€ arising from the traffic risk sharing mechanism.

<p style = "margin-bottom: 0px;">**Austro Control overall regulatory result (RR) for the terminal activity**</p>

Ex-post, the overall RR taking into account the net loss from the terminal activity mentioned above (-1.7 M€) and the actual RoE (+0.3 M€) amounts to -1.4 M€ (-3.1% of the terminal revenues). The resulting ex-post rate of return on equity is -34.0%.
