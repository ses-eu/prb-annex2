## Airports
### Overview
Norway has identified four airports as subject to RP2 monitoring. However, in accordance with IR (EU) 2019/317 and the traffic figures, only two of these airports (Oslo (EGNM) and Bergen (ENBR)) must be monitored for pre-departure delays. Oslo (A-CDM implemented) is the only Norwegian airport that has finished the full implementation of the Airport Operator Data Flow required for the monitoring of these pre-departure delays. <br/>Regarding the APDF implementation and the calculation of the pre-departure delays at Bergen, Norway's monitoring  mentions that Avinor's IT-department is set on the case, and expected to be solved for calculating the 2023 figures.<br/>Traffic at the ensemble of these four Norwegian airports in 2022 was still 10% lower than in 2019.<br/><br/>Average arrival ATFM delays in 2022 was 0.10 min/arr, compared to 0.01 min/arr in 2021.<br/>ATFM slot adherence has improved (2022: 99.3%; 2021: 98.6%).

Arrival ATFM delays in 2021 decreased and became marginal at all Norwegian airports. However in 2022 Oslo showed a significant increase in arrival delays (ENGM; 2019: 0.31 min/arr; 2020: 0.05 min/arr; 2021: 0.01 min/arr;  2021: 0.17 min/arr) while the rest of airports registered minimum delays.
51% of the arrival ATFM delays in Norway were attributed to Weather, followed by ATC Staffing issues (39%) at Oslo.

All Norwegian airports showed adherence above 98% and the national average was 99.3%. With regard to the 0.7% of flights that did not adhere, 0.3% was early and 0.4% was late.,

### ATC Pre-departure Delay
The calculation of the ATC pre-departure delay is based on the data provided by the airport operators through the Airport Operator Data Flow (APDF) which is properly implemented at Oslo but not implemented at Bergen. Therefore the monitoring of this indicator in Norway is limited to Oslo.<br/>The performance at Oslo has slightly deteriorated (ENGM; 2019: 0.14 min/dep.; 2020: 0.05 min/dep.; 2021: 0.06 min/dep.; 2022: 0.10 min/dep.)<br/><br/>According to the Norwegian monitoring report: *Pre-departure delay in 2022 (ENGM)  is increasing compared to the two previous years during the pandemic,  but still below the level before the pandemic (2017-2019).*


### All Causes Pre-departure Delay
The calculation of the All causes pre-departure delay is based on the data provided by the airport operators through the Airport Operator Data Flow (APDF) which is properly implemented at Oslo but not implemented at Bergen. Therefore the monitoring of this indicator in Norway is limited to Oslo.<br/>The total (all causes) delay in the actual off block time at Oslo increased again in 2022 (ENGM: 2020: 5.01 min/dep.; 2021: 6.74 min/dep.; 2022: 12.74 min/dep.) but still resulting in the third lowest value among the RP3 monitored airports. The highest delays per flight were observed in December, averaging more than 20 min/dep.
