### ATC Pre-departure Delay
The performance in terms of ATC pre-departure delay at Budapest has further improved with respect to the previous years (LHBP; 2019: 0.30 min/dep.; 2020: 0.16 min/dep.; 2021: 0.14 min/dep.;  2022: 0.10 min/dep.)


### All Causes Pre-departure Delay
The total (all causes) delay in the actual off block time at Budapest significantly increased in 2022 (LHBP: 2020: 12.58 min/dep.; 2021: 15.61 min/dep.; 2022: 21.12 min/dep.). The highest delays per flight were observed in June and July averaging more than 30 min/dep.<br/>According to the Hungarian monitoring report: *The actual performance in this respect was a bit worse than in the previous years, which could be explained with the overall staffing issues at the LHBP. After COVID-19 pandemic similar staffing problems were  experienced at many airport in Europe.*
