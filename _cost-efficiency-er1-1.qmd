### 2 Monitoring of the en route determined unit cost (DUC) at charging zone level
  The **Determined Unit Cost (DUC)** is the cost per service unit, at which the service is planned to be provided during the year. The **Actual Unit Cost (AUC)** reflects the cost per service unit, at which the service has actually been provided during the year.<br/><br/>The monitoring of the DUC / AUC is carried out in national currency in real terms, at 2017 prices.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0rem;">**AUC vs. DUC**<br/>In 2022, the en route AUC was -7.0% (or -38.27 NOK2017, -4.1 €2017) lower than the planned DUC, resulting from significantly lower than planned en route costs in real terms (-5.9%, or -66.6 MNOK2017, -7.1 M€2017) and higher than planned TSUs (+1.1%). It should be noted that actual inflation index in 2022 was +6.5 p.p. higher than planned.<br/>**En route service units**<br/>The difference between actual and planned TSUs (+1.1%) falls within the ±2% dead band. Hence the resulting additional en route revenue is kept by the ANSPs (see items 10 to 14).<br/>**En route costs by entity**<br/>Actual real en route costs are -5.9% (-7.1 M€2017) lower than planned. This is the result of lower costs for the main ANSP, Avinor (-5.9%, or -6.5 M€2017), the MET service provider (-23.7%, or -0.3 M€2017), the other ANSP (KJE, -31.9%, or -0.2 M€2017) and the NSA/EUROCONTROL (-1.0%, or -0.1 M€2017).<br/>E**n route costs for the main ANSP (Avinor) at charging zone leve**l<br/>Significantly lower than planned en route costs in real terms for Avinor in 2022 (-5.9%, or -6.5 M€2017) result from the combination of:<br/>- Significantly lower staff costs (-10.7%), mainly due to *"the restructuring of the organization. The support staff costs are reduced as these recourses (HR, finance, legal, communication etc.) have been moved to the mother company Avinor AS. As a consequence, staff support costs are instead accounted as an intercompany purchase/other operating costs."*<br/>- Significantly higher other operating costs (+22.4%), due to the organizational restructuring (see above), higher energy prices and travel expenses after the end of Covid-19;<br/>- Significantly lower depreciation (-11.3%), reported to be due to the overestimation of planned depreciation in the RP3 performance plan, which will be reimbursed to airspace users through the mechanism of costs exempted from cost sharing in 2024;<br/>- Significantly higher cost of capital (+7.7%), *"due to a higher share of the investments that is allocated to the en-route cost base than estimated in the determined costs"*; and,<br/>- Significantly higher deduction for VFR exempted flights (+64.2%).**</p>

### 5 Monitoring of the en route actual unit cost for users (AUCU) at charging zone level
The **Actual Unit Cost for Users(AUCU)** reflects the price per service units that is charged *in fine* to users for the services provided in the year. It corresponds to the sum of the DUC for the year and of the different adjustments stemming from that year.
The monitoring of the AUCU is carried out in national currency in nominal terms.

### 9 Focus on en route AUCU monitoring at charging zone level
The actual en route unit cost incurred by airspace users (AUCU) in respect of activities performed in 2022 (556.45 NOK or 55.12 €) is -6.2% lower than the nominal DUC (592.96 NOK or 58.73 €). The difference between these two figures (-36.51 NOK/SU or -3.62 €/SU) is due to:<br/>- the positive inflation adjustment resulting from higher than planned inflation (+26.33 NOK/SU or +2.61 €/SU);<br/>- the impact of adjustments resulting from the costs exempted from cost-sharing mechanism (-0.23 NOK/SU or -0.02 €/SU);<br/>- the deduction of the traffic adjustment (-0.50 NOK/SU or -0.05 €/SU) for the costs not subject to traffic risk sharing;<br/>- the deduction of the other revenues (-0.90 NOK/SU or -0.09 €/SU); and<br/>- application of a lower unit rate as foreseen in Art. 29(6) in year 2022  (-61.21 NOK/SU or -6.06 €/SU); and<br/>The share of regulatory result (see items 10 to 14) in the AUCU (before the deduction of other revenues) is 13.0%.
