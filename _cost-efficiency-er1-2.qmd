## En route main ANSP (HungaroControl (EC))
### 10 Monitoring of the en route ANSPs regulatory results (RR)
The **Regulatory Result (RR)** corresponds to the revenues generated by the activities of the year, that exceed the direct and indirect operating costs of an ANSP, and so provide for a reasonable return on assets to contribute towards necessary capital improvements. The notion of RR focuses on the ANSP results entitled to the ANS activity in the year. It is therefore different from the net accounting profit disclosed in ANSPs financial statements. Also, it does not take into account any opportunity cost.<br/>The RR, when expressed in percentage of the revenues, can be associated to a “margin” generated by the ANSP with respect to the activity of the year, but it is not comparable to the margin that would be calculated straight from ANSPs financial statements.<br/> - Ex-ante, the RR is equal to the RoE (in value) included in the determined cost of capital.<br/> - Ex-post, the RR is the sum of the RoE (in value) in the actual cost of capital and the net gain/loss resulting from risk sharing and incentives generated from that year.<br/>The **net gain/loss** calculated in box 11 results from the combination of three distinct items: a) the outcome of the cost-sharing mechanism to be retained by the ANSP (including the impact of costs exempted from cost-sharing and of the inflation adjustment); b) the outcome of the traffic risk sharing mechanism; and c) the outcome of the financial incentive mechanism for capacity and environment targets (not applicable for 2022). <br/>The monitoring of the RR is carried out in national currency in nominal terms.<br/>

<p style = "margin-bottom: 0px;">**HungaroControl net gain on activity in the Hungary en route charging zone in the year 2022**</p>

HungaroControl reported a net gain of +6 283.7 MHUF, as a combination of a gain of +4 795.1 MHUF arising from the cost sharing mechanism, with a gain of +1 488.6 MHUF arising from the traffic risk sharing mechanism.

<p style = "margin-bottom: 0px;">**HungaroControl overall regulatory result (RR) for the en route activity**</p>

Ex-post, the overall RR taking into account the net gain from the en route activity mentioned above (+6 283.7 MHUF) and the actual RoE (+2 915.5 MHUF) amounts to +9 199.3 MHUF (24.0% of the en route revenues). The resulting ex-post rate of return on equity is 22.6%, which is higher than the 8.0% planned in the PP.
