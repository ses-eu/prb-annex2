### 2 Monitoring of the en route determined unit cost (DUC) at charging zone level
  The **Determined Unit Cost (DUC)** is the cost per service unit, at which the service is planned to be provided during the year. The **Actual Unit Cost (AUC)** reflects the cost per service unit, at which the service has actually been provided during the year.<br/><br/>The monitoring of the DUC / AUC is carried out in national currency in real terms, at 2017 prices.

### 4 Focus on en route DUC monitoring at charging zone level

<p style="margin-bottom: 0rem;">**AUC vs. DUC**</p>

In 2022, the en route AUC was -35.7% (or -142.04 HRK2017, -19.04 €2017) lower than the planned DUC. This results from the combination of significantly higher than planned TSUs (+40.9%) and significantly lower than planned en route costs in real terms (-9.4%, or -59.1 MHRK2017, -7.9 M€2017). It should be noted that actual inflation index in 2022 was +12.1 p.p. higher than planned.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0rem;">**En route service units**</p>

The difference between actual and planned TSUs (+40.9%) falls outside the ±10% threshold foreseen in the traffic risk sharing mechanism. The resulting gain of additional en route revenues is therefore shared between the ANSP and the airspace users, with the ANSP (Croatia Control) retaining an amount of +2.8 M€2017.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0rem;">**En route costs by entity**</p>

Actual real en route costs are -9.4% (-7.9 M€2017) lower than planned. This is the result of lower costs for the main ANSP, Croatia Control (-10.2%, or -8.0 M€2017) and higher costs for the NSA/EUROCONTROL (+1.1%, or +0.07 M€2017).

<p style="margin-bottom: 0rem;">**En route costs for the main ANSP (Croatia Control) at charging zone level**</p>

Significantly lower than planned en route costs in real terms for Croatia Control in 2022 (-10.2%, or -8.0 M€2017) result from:<br/>- Significantly lower staff costs (-12.3%), due to not fully realized recruitment plan. This result is also impacted by higher actual inflation index (+12.1 p.p.). <br/>- Significantly lower other operating costs (-7.5%), mainly due to inflation index impact (+12.1 p.p.) since in nominal terms other operating costs are higher than planned by 3.2%. <br/>- Significantly lower depreciation (-5.4%), due to lower than planned realization of capex due to logistic and production delays and decommissioning of some CC's assets. <br/>- Lower cost of capital (-4.7%), due to lower than expected assets base. <br/>- Significantly lower deduction for VFR exempted flights (-11.8%).<br/>

### 5 Monitoring of the en route actual unit cost for users (AUCU) at charging zone level
The **Actual Unit Cost for Users(AUCU)** reflects the price per service units that is charged *in fine* to users for the services provided in the year. It corresponds to the sum of the DUC for the year and of the different adjustments stemming from that year.
The monitoring of the AUCU is carried out in national currency in nominal terms.

### 9 Focus on en route AUCU monitoring at charging zone level
The actual en route unit cost incurred by airspace users (AUCU) in respect of activities performed in 2022 (314.27 HRK or 41.73 €) is -23.6% lower than the nominal DUC (411.32 HRK or 54.61 €). The difference between these two figures (-97.05 HRK/SU or -12.89 €/SU) is due to:<br/>- the positive inflation adjustment resulting from higher than planned inflation (+26.19 HRK/SU or +3.48 €/SU);<br/>- the impact of adjustments resulting from the costs exempted from cost-sharing mechanism (+4.40 HRK/SU or +0.58 €/SU);<br/>- the deduction of the traffic risk sharing adjustments (-91.95 HRK/SU or -12.21 €/SU);<br/>- the deduction of the traffic adjustment (-16.33 HRK/SU or -2.17 €/SU) for the costs not subject to traffic risk sharing; and<br/>- the deduction of the other revenues (-19.35 HRK/SU or -2.57 €/SU).<br/>The share of the regulatory result (see items 10 to 13) in the AUCU (before the deduction of other revenues) is 18.4%.<br/>
