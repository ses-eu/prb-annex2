### 2 Monitoring of the en route determined unit cost (DUC) at charging zone level
  The **Determined Unit Cost (DUC)** is the cost per service unit, at which the service is planned to be provided during the year. The **Actual Unit Cost (AUC)** reflects the cost per service unit, at which the service has actually been provided during the year.<br/><br/>The monitoring of the DUC / AUC is carried out in national currency in real terms, at 2017 prices.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0rem;">**AUC vs. DU**C<br/>In 2022, the en route AUC was -6.0% (or -2.27 €2017) lower than the planned DUC. This results from the combination of significantly lower than planned en route costs in real terms (-6.0%, or -1.1 M€2017) and TSUs that are in line with the plan. It should be noted that actual inflation index in 2022 was +7.8 p.p. higher than planned.<br/><br/>E**n route service unit**s<br/>The difference between actual and planned TSUs (-0.1%) falls inside the ±2% dead band. Hence loss of en route revenues is borne by the ANSPs (see items 10 to 14).<br/><br/>E**n route costs by entit**y<br/>Actual real en route costs are -6.0% (-1.1 M€2017) lower than planned. This is the result of lower costs for the main ANSP, LGS (-5.8%, or -0.9 M€2017), the NSA/EUROCONTROL (-7.4%, or -0.2 M€2017) and the MET service provider (-6.6%, or -0.02 M€2017).<br/><br/>E**n route costs for the main ANSP (LGS) at charging zone leve**l<br/>Significantly lower than planned en route costs in real terms for LGS in 2022 (-5.8%, or -0.9 M€2017) result from:<br/>- Significantly lower staff costs (-9.1%), mainly due to the war in Ukraine, which did not allow a return to pre-COVID situation and had an impact on staff plan and on reallocation of costs between En-route and Terminal, based on Activity Based Costing method.<br/>- Significantly lower other operating costs (-13.1%), resulting from austerity measures required by the new crisis situation (ATCOs training courses cancelled, reduction of direct spending for ATCOs...). <br/>- Significantly higher depreciation (+7.4%), due to the commissioning of several large investment projects, mostly related to ATS and launched before the pandemic. A number of unplanned investments for the ACC also resulted in higher-than-expected costs.<br/>- Significantly higher cost of capital (+6.4%). This can be explained by the fact that a number of investments were commissioned slightly earlier than planned, resulting in higher costs.<br/>- Significantly lower deduction for VFR exempted flights (-12.4%).<br/>**</p>

### 5 Monitoring of the en route actual unit cost for users (AUCU) at charging zone level
The **Actual Unit Cost for Users(AUCU)** reflects the price per service units that is charged *in fine* to users for the services provided in the year. It corresponds to the sum of the DUC for the year and of the different adjustments stemming from that year.
The monitoring of the AUCU is carried out in national currency in nominal terms.

### 9 Focus on en route AUCU monitoring at charging zone level
The actual en route unit cost incurred by airspace users (AUCU) in respect of activities performed in 2022 (44.43 €) is +3.3% higher than the nominal DUC (43.03 €). The difference between these two figures (+1.40 €/SU) is due to:<br/>- the positive inflation adjustment resulting from higher than planned inflation (+1.99 €/SU);<br/>- the impact of adjustments resulting from the costs exempted from cost-sharing mechanism (-0.23 €/SU);<br/>- the addition of the traffic adjustment (+0.01 €/SU) for the costs not subject to traffic risk sharing; and<br/>- the deduction of the other revenues (-0.36 €/SU).<br/>The share of the regulatory result (see items 10 to 14) in the AUCU (before the deduction of other revenues) is 11.2%.
