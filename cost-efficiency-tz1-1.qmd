### 2 Monitoring of the terminal determined unit cost (DUC) at charging zone level
  The **Determined Unit Cost (DUC)** is the cost per service unit, at which the service is planned to be provided during the year. The **Actual Unit Cost (AUC)** reflects the cost per service unit, at which the service has actually been provided during the year.<br/><br/>The monitoring of the DUC / AUC is carried out in national currency in real terms, at 2017 prices.
