### 2 Monitoring of the terminal determined unit cost (DUC) at charging zone level
  The **Determined Unit Cost (DUC)** is the cost per service unit, at which the service is planned to be provided during the year. The **Actual Unit Cost (AUC)** reflects the cost per service unit, at which the service has actually been provided during the year.<br/><br/>The monitoring of the DUC / AUC is carried out in national currency in real terms, at 2017 prices.

### 4 Focus on terminal DUC monitoring at charging zone level

<p style="margin-bottom: 0rem;">**AUC vs. DUC**</p>

In 2022, the terminal AUC was +19.6% (or +43.9 €2017) higher than the planned DUC. This results from the combination of significantly lower than planned TNSUs (-13.4%) and higher than planned terminal costs in real terms (+3.6%, or +1.5 M€2017). It should be noted that actual inflation index in 2022 was +7.0 p.p. higher than planned.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0rem;">**Terminal service units**</p>

The difference between actual and planned TNSUs (-13.4%) falls outside the ±10% threshold foreseen in the traffic risk sharing mechanism. The resulting loss of terminal revenues is therefore shared between the ANSP and the airspace users, with the ANSP (Austro Control) bearing a loss of -1.5 M€2017.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0rem;">**Terminal costs by entity**</p>

Actual real terminal costs are +3.6% (+1.5 M€2017) higher than planned. This is the result of higher costs for the main ANSP, Austro Control (+5.8%, or +2.2 M€2017) and lower costs for the NSA (-39.7%, or -0.1 M€2017), and the MET service provider (-18.2%, or -0.7 M€2017).

<p style="margin-bottom: 0rem;">**Terminal costs for the main ANSP (Austro Control) at charging zone level**</p>

Higher than planned terminal costs in real terms for Austro Control in 2022 (+5.8%, or +2.2 M€2017) result from:<br/>- Significantly higher staff costs (+13.6%), "*staff costs were impacted by inflation and effects of Coronavirus on the smaller units. In addition, the pension costs were higher than determined."* <br/>- Lower other operating costs (-3.4%), due to the inflation index impact  (+7.0 p.p.) since in nominal terms the costs are higher than planned (+2.7%);<br/>- Significantly lower depreciation (-8.1%), reflecting delayed investments due to the impact of COVID-19; <br/>- Significantly lower cost of capital (-29.1%), reflecting delayed investments and "*short-term financing conditions of the Republic of Austria, due to which the average net working capital was subject to interest at 0% in 2021*" ;<br/>- Lower exceptional costs (-6.0%).<br/>

### 5 Monitoring of the terminal actual unit cost for users (AUCU) at charging zone level
The **Actual Unit Cost for Users(AUCU)** reflects the price per service units that is charged *in fine* to users for the services provided in the year. It corresponds to the sum of the DUC for the year and of the different adjustments stemming from that year.
The monitoring of the AUCU is carried out in national currency in nominal terms.

### 9 Focus on terminal AUCU monitoring at charging zone level
The actual terminal unit cost incurred by airspace users (AUCU) in respect of activities performed in 2022 (301.37 €) is +24.5% higher than the nominal DUC (242.02 €). The difference between these two figures (+59.35 €/SU) is due to:<br/>- the positive inflation adjustment resulting from higher than planned inflation (+14.57 €/SU);<br/>- the impact of adjustments resulting from the costs exempted from cost-sharing mechanism (+18.49 €/SU);<br/>- the addition of the traffic risk sharing adjustments (+22.92 €/SU); and<br/>- the addition of the traffic adjustment (+3.38 €/SU) for the costs not subject to traffic risk sharing.<br/>The share of the regulatory result (see items 10 to 14) in the AUCU (before the deduction of other revenues) is -0.9%.<br/>
