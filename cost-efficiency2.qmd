## 4.2 En route main ANSP (Skyguide) {.unnumbered}
### Monitoring of the en route ANSPs regulatory results (RR)
The Regulatory Result (RR) corresponds to the revenues generated by the activities of the year, that exceed the direct and indirect operating costs of an ANSP, and so provide for a reasonable return on assets to contribute towards necessary capital improvements. The notion of RR focuses on the ANSP results entitled to the ANS activity in the year. It is therefore different from the net accounting profit disclosed in ANSPs financial statements. Also, it does not take into account any opportunity cost.
The RR, when expressed in percentage of the revenues, can be associated to a “margin” generated by the ANSP with respect to the activity of the year, but it is not comparable to the margin that would be calculated straight from ANSPs financial statements.
 - Ex-ante, the RR is equal to the RoE (in value) included in the determined cost of capital.
 - Ex-post, the RR is the sum of the RoE (in value) in the actual cost of capital and the net gain/loss resulting from risk sharing and incentives generated from that year.
The net gain/loss calculated in box 11 results from the combination of three distinct items: a) the outcome of the cost-sharing mechanism to be retained by the ANSP (including the impact of costs exempted from cost-sharing and of the inflation adjustment); b) the outcome of the traffic risk sharing mechanism; and c) the outcome of the financial incentive mechanism for capacity and environment targets (not applicable for 2022). 
The monitoring of the RR is carried out in national currency in nominal terms.

Note 1: Ex-post RR does not take into account the application of the lower unit rate as per Art. 29.6 in 2022. This application generated losses of -15.7 MCHF for entities providing services in the en route charging zone (-5.3 MCHF for skyguide and -10.3 MCHF for MET SP).

Skyguide reported a net loss of -3.8 MCHF, as a combination of a gain of +0.04 MCHF arising from the cost sharing mechanism, with a loss of -3.8 MCHF arising from the traffic risk sharing mechanism.

<p style = "margin-bottom: 0px;">**Skyguide overall regulatory results (RR) for the en route activity**</p>

Ex-post, the overall RR taking into account the net loss from the en route activity mentioned above (-3.8 MCHF) and the actual RoE (+2.8 MCHF) amounts to -1.0 MCHF (-0.6% of the en route revenues). The resulting ex-post rate of return on equity is -2.4%. See also Note 1 above.
